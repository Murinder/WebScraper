    "title": "Palestinians File German Complaint on Media Giant Axel Springer’s Business in Israeli Settlements",
    "author": "Hanno Hauenstein",

    "text": "Five Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, along with the councils of three villages they hail from, filed a formal regulatory complaint in Germany accusing the media giant Axel Springer of contributing to human rights abuses in Palestine. The villagers said that Axel Springer’s Israeli subsidiary Yad2, a classified ads platform akin to Craigslist, enables Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\nThe Palestinian complainants cited Yad2’s role in hosting listings, sometimes for a fee, that facilitate sales, rentals, and new construction projects in Israeli settlements, which are considered by most countries of the world to be illegal under international law.\nFiled by the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Centre on behalf of the Palestinians, the complaint says that Yad2’s facilitation of settlement activity — which was first reported by The Intercept — fuels Israeli land grabbing and therefore violates Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Passed last year, the law requires German companies to identify and mitigate human rights risks within their global supply chains, including in subsidiaries which they control.\n“Contributing to land theft and unlawful evictions of Palestinians in the West Bank would be a direct violation of the Supply Chain Act,” said Annabell Brüggemann, the legal adviser on business and human rights at the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, an independent nonprofit based in Berlin. “Springer must therefore ensure that it does not contribute to the maintenance or deepening of these abuses through its business activities.”\nThe complaint will go through an initial period of review by regulators to examine its merit, particularly looking at the level of Springer’s influence over Yad2, before it becomes a full-fledged investigation. Julia Sommerfeld, a spokesperson for Axel Springer, said on Saturday that the company had not received any information about the complaint.\nThe complainants, who hail from the West Bank communities of Iskaka, Marda, and Taybeh, are calling for action from Germany’s Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control, an agency under the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology that is known as BAFA.\nThey are demanding accountability, including fines of up to 2 percent of Springer’s annual revenue — a financial penalty that, if taken seriously, could run into the millions of euros — and an immediate suspension of all Yad2 listings tied to settlements.\n“If BAFA acts decisively,” said Robert Grabosch, one of the lawyers supporting the plaintiffs with their complaint, “illegal listings could be removed within days.”\nShowing Springer’s decisive influence with its subsidiary could lead BAFA to force the removal of the offending real estate listings, said Brüggemann, the legal expert.\n“Based on everything that is known about the case, I expect the BAFA to take the complaint very seriously,” she said. “This would mean ensuring no further ads for properties in occupied territories can be placed on Yad2.” (BAFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\nWhile BAFA’s bureaucratic processes are slow — similar complaints have dragged on for many months without resolution — Brüggemann said that, in urgent cases, the regulatory body has the authority to impose provisional measures.\n“When legal violations risk becoming irreversible,” she said, “BAFA can act quickly.”\nThe complaint draws on the International Court of Justice’s July 2024 advisory opinion, which outlined the legal consequences of Israel’s practices in the occupied Palestinian territories. The international court reaffirmed the obligation of states to prohibit business activities that sustain Israel’s illegal occupation.\nThe Palestinians’ complaint, however, is grounded firmly in German law, invoking the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act’s requirement that corporations ensure their global operations do not contribute to human rights violations.\nThe complaint includes maps that starkly depict the Palestinians’ case: Yad2 property listings in the settlements of Ariel and Rimonim encroach on land belonging to Iskaka, Marda, and Taybeh, the Palestinian communities whose village councils joined the Palestinian villagers in filing the case.\nThe case for Springer to halt Yad2’s settlement listings comes at a time of intensifying violence in the West Bank. Since October 2023, following Hamas’s attack on southern Israel and the unrelenting assault on Gaza in response, Israeli settlers have launched over 1,400 violent attacks, according to the United Nations.\nIsraeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right coalition member and himself a settler, has made explicit calls for annexing the West Bank — emboldening settlers to launch attacks and seize land.\nAxel Springer is a major global player in news media. Internationally, the company owns a host of influential outlets, including Politico and Business Insider in the U.S.\nEurope’s largest publisher, the conglomerate also owns several German outlets, including Bild, the country’s biggest newspaper. Springer also owns Upday, Europe’s largest news aggregator app.\nSpringer enshrines support for Israel in its mission statement, formal internal guidance that the company calls its “essentials.” All of Springer’s subsidiaries and employees are bound to uphold this stance. In October 2023, the firm fired a Lebanese employee who questioned the pro-Israel policy.\nUnder a deal agreed to this fall, the U.S.-based investment firm KKR and Canada’s CPP will take control of Axel Springer’s lucrative classified ads business, including the real estate platform Aviv, which runs Yad2, by the middle of next year. Axel Springer’s German owners, Mathias Döpfner and Friede Springer, will retain a minority stake in the ads business controlled by KKR, which is itself currently a minority stakeholder in Springer. Whether BAFA will take action before the deal is consummated remains to be seen.\nCritics say Springer’s media empire holds disproportionate sway over German discourse on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bild, for example, has faced criticism for fostering anti-Palestinian bias. At Upday, The Intercept previously reported, company leadership handed down directives early in Israel’s war on Gaza that prioritized the toll on Israelis over the toll on Palestinians.",

    "title": "Three Teachers Tried to Give Palestinian Students a Safe Haven — and It Cost Them Their Jobs",
    "author": "Emily Rizzo",
    "date": "2024-12-03T05:00:00-05:00",
    "text": "Mohammed, a middle school student in Philadelphia, puts on his “Free Gaza” bracelet as routinely as he brushes his teeth. He often wears a keffiyeh around his shoulders, despite, he said, being told at school to take it off.\n“He’s so sure about who he is and what he wants to represent, he doesn’t care,” said Mariam, his mother.\nLike many young Palestinian students across the country, Mohammed, who like his mother asked to use a pseudonym for fear of reprisals, has grown more political over the last year. His grandmother lives in the West Bank, and two of his cousins were killed by the Israeli military, part of the civilian death toll of Israel’s war on Gaza.\nIn November 2023, Mohammed’s English teacher at Philadelphia’s Baldi Middle School, Caroline Yang, and two other seventh grade teachers, Emily Antrilli and Jordan Kardasz, sensed Mohammed and other Muslim and Palestinian students needed a safe place to express themselves. Yang opened her classroom after school. The war was around a month old, and emotions were running high on all sides.\nThe students decided to make posters. One listed names of Palestinian children killed by Israeli soldiers. Another showed a dove between Israeli and Palestinian flags. Some of the posters were adorned with slogans like “End apartheid,” “This is not war, this is genocide,” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” Some of the posters contained red handprints; other handprints showed the red, white, green, and black of the Palestinian flag.\nThe teachers put up the signs, along with a Palestinian flag, in the school’s commons on November 17, 2023. The new display would accompany the flags of over 30 other nations, including Israel’s. Within an hour, before classes began, the school removed them, according to the teachers and a principal’s report obtained by The Intercept.\nSoon, the posters would become the flashpoint in allegations and recriminations that included accusations of anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim bias, as well as antisemitism. By the time the dust settled with the end of the school year last summer, the fallout had hit students and teachers alike. Some parents decided to pull students from the school. The three teachers had all left their jobs — and decided to file a federal civil rights complaint.\n“Silencing. Erasure,” said Mariam, Mohammed’s mother, who was considering pulling both children from Baldi but ultimately kept them enrolled. “They don’t want us to be loud. They don’t want us to be anything.”\nAcross the country, students and educators who have advocated for Palestinians have faced censorship and professional repercussions. The Council on American Islamic Relations, the country’s largest Muslim civil rights organization, is suing a Maryland school district for allegedly placing three teachers on administrative leave for supporting Palestinian rights. Last October, two Minnesota public high school students were suspended for chanting “from the river to the sea.”\nIn Philadelphia schools, Israel’s war on Gaza had already sparked a furor. Protests erupted after a student podcast was censored by the district, and ad hoc groups have formed to make demands about Palestinian rights from the school system. The district has since suspended the teacher who assigned the censored project and who faced allegations of bias against supporters of Israel. District parents have since petitioned for her reinstatement and questioned the district’s motives.\nAs for Yang, Antrilli, and Kardasz, the teachers at Baldi, school district communications officer Christina Clark said Philadelphia schools seek to create inclusive learning environments in the full knowledge that their actions will shape students’ lives, but would not comment on personnel matters. Baldi’s principal, Bianca Gillis, did not respond to The Intercept’s multiple requests for comment. In a report summarizing multiple disciplinary hearings, Gillis wrote that the posters and flag caused staff pain and “had a negative and profound impact on Israeli and non Israeli staff.”\n“We encourage all of us, staff, community members, and stakeholders of all kinds, to be the role models they deserve,” Clark wrote in a statement to The Intercept. She said the district has held two student forums to allow dialogue between the communities involved. The district has also partnered with the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education for workshops with district and school leaders “to increase understanding of antisemitism and Islamophobia.”\nFor the teachers, however, facilitating the posters was more than just a nod to inclusivity.\n“With that many Palestinian students in our school,” Yang said, “I would not be able to sit right with myself if, as a teacher, I didn’t do anything while a genocide is happening.”\nA month after the posters and flag were put up and taken down, the principal recommended that the district suspend the teachers without pay for five days and transfer them to different schools. The subsequent investigation, concluded in April, confirmed the disciplinary measures, though by the time the process was over, the recommendation for Kardasz’s transfer had been rescinded.\nIn May, with a month left in the school year, district officials ordered the teachers to stop teaching and work from home. Before the suspensions could be imposed, all three teachers resigned. None of them felt that they could be good teachers under the circumstances.\nThe punishments were related to allegations that the teachers disobeyed an order to stay neutral on the war in Gaza, violated an administrative directive to email suggestions on ways to support the school community to the principal, broke three district policies, and created a “hostile work environment” for other staff members, according to disciplinary reports obtained by The Intercept. Other teachers, the report said, were afraid of “continued antisemitism” at work.\n“Your actions indicate a select group of teachers exclusively, intentionally and purposefully discussing, planning and engaging students in an activity that was not discussed or approved with the administration of Baldi school and undermined efforts to address a serious and difficult issue for students and staff,” Gillis wrote in a disciplinary report.\nWhen they were ordered to work from home, the teachers were told not to discuss the matter with other colleagues or students.\n“My thought process was that it would start a conversation,” said Yang. “I never thought that it would lead to the backlash that it did.”\nIn response, the teachers, who were all in their first year at Baldi, filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, alleging that the school discriminated against Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim students, infringed on students’ First Amendment-protected speech, and disciplined the teachers for their support of Palestinian students and Palestinian human rights.\n“I want teachers who are going through something similar, who feel silenced at their schools, to know it’s not just them,” said Yang. “The district needs to protect teachers’ right to teach and talk about Palestine, not leave it up to each principal’s will.”\nThe federal complaint also alleged that the school rescinded accommodations for Muslim students to make an afternoon prayer during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Mohammed and other Muslim students said they had not been allowed to carry out the time-specific prayer. Clark, the district spokesperson, told The Intercept that students can pray during school hours, but prayer should not be held during instructional time to minimize “academic interruption.”\nThe civil rights complaint and students interviewed by The Intercept, including Mohammed, have also alleged that educators told them to remove their keffiyehs, the checkered Palestinian scarves. (Clark said that Baldi students “may wear keffiyehs on dress down days and during the regular school day.”)\nThe Department of Education is evaluating the complaint and has not yet made a determination on whether it will open an investigation into the district, according to an attorney who helped the teachers file the complaint.\nIn Philadelphia schools, Arabic is the fifth-most spoken language, according to the district, with a large number of Arab students residing in northeast Philadelphia, where Mohammed lives.\nAt Baldi, the school has instituted “healing circles” led by the district’s diversity, equity, and inclusion office, with students responding overwhelmingly to a school survey that they feel safe and supported, according to the report from Gillis, the Baldi principal.\nIn October, however, the school’s assistant principal directed teachers to stay “neutral” on Gaza, according to the teachers. And in November 2023, during an all-staff meeting, Gillis gave a verbal directive that teachers must email her if they have suggestions for ways to support students. The teachers hung the posters and flag despite that order — followed by the response from other faculty members described in internal reports.\n“Staff members shared concerns of being safe in our building and that the Jewish community felt discriminated against, marginalized and hated,” says one of the disciplinary reports obtained by The Intercept. “Tears were shed in Principal Gillis’ office over the fear of continued Antisemitism.”\nThe lawyer who helped the teachers file their federal complaint said the school’s actions appeared to be an attempt to punish teachers for facilitating students’ speech.\n“I think they’re trying to find a way to censor student speech without running afoul of the law,” said Noelia Rivera-Calderón, an education civil rights attorney and member of Palestine Legal Attorney Network.\nThe teachers said a double standard is at work on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Philadelphia schools. They pointed to the Israeli flag in the commons and another one in Baldi’s main office, next to Italian and American flags. And neutrality is a facade, they said: In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the teachers allege the school had pro-Ukrainian student art on a hallway bulletin board.\nIn May, Gillis stated that any signage, writing, or clothing that supported “’only one country’ created an unsafe environment, specifically noting that any sign of Palestine was unsafe for Jewish students,” according to the federal complaint.\nNone of the other displays stirred the sort of controversy or discipline that has erupted over the Palestinian flag and posters. The OCR complaint alleges that disciplinary meetings “made clear that Baldi administration’s concerns with the posters were not procedural but due to their pro-Palestine content.”\n“The punishment is not because we hung up posters, the punishment is not because we didn’t have parents’ permission after school, they’re going to say that that’s what it is,” said Kardasz, one of the teachers. “But the punishment is the fact that these posters are pro-Palestinian, they are anti-genocide, they are anti-violence towards Palestinian people.”\n“The kids who made the posters believed in a free Palestine before they even knew who the three of us were,” Kardasz said. “They found teachers who they felt comfortable saying that to.”\nWhen Mohammed’s mother Mariam found out about the posters, she said she was ecstatic. She said, “Because that meant that somebody was recognizing them for who they are.”\nOne Baldi student involved in making the posters told The Intercept that a school official had told the student to remove their keffiyeh, they said, because it violated the school uniform.\nIn contrast, the student said being in Yang’s classroom in November and making posters instilled a sense of pride, “because I knew there were people who stood with us.”\n“I thought it was the best we could do to show our solidarity,” said the student, whose mother requested they remain anonymous. “Since you’re still a middle schooler, you can’t do much.”\nThe student’s mother took her kids out of Baldi and placed them in a private school.\n“Having Ms. Yang there just made me feel at peace, like someone cares about Palestinian life,” the mother said. “And the fact that they kicked her out for doing that just made me feel like it’s just not a place I want my kids to be.”\nAntrilli, who’s lived in Philadelphia for seven years, is now teaching at a charter school across the river in Camden, New Jersey. That decision wasn’t easy.\n“I was ready to have my career with this district,” said Antrilli, who had been in her first year at Baldi. “The district will just keep going the way that it’s going, and it’s going to lose teachers like us who really want to help these kids, and these kids have to still go into these schools and feel this way every day.”\nKardasz, for her part, is teaching at a community college in the Philadelphia suburbs. As for Yang, she isn’t sure if she will return to teaching at all.\nSitting in his living room this past June, Mohammed posed a question to his mother: “Am I ever going to see Ms. Yang again?”",

    "title": "Documents Contradict Google’s Claims About Its Project Nimbus Contract With Israel",
    "author": "Sam Biddle",
    "date": "2024-12-02T21:33:06-05:00",
    "text": "When questioned about its controversial cloud computing contract with the Israeli government, Google has repeatedly claimed the so-called Project Nimbus deal is bound by the company’s general cloud computing terms of service policy. While that policy would prohibit uses that lead to deprivation of rights, injury, or death, or other harms, contract documents and an internal company email reviewed by The Intercept show the deal forged between Google and Israel doesn’t operate under the tech company’s general terms of service. Rather, Nimbus is subject to an “adjusted” policy drafted between Google and the Israeli government. It is unclear how this “Adjusted Terms of Service” policy differs from Google’s typical terms.\nThe $1.2 billion joint contract split between Google and Amazon provides the Israeli government, including its military, with access to state-of-the-art cloud computing and artificial intelligence tools. This has made Project Nimbus a consistent source of protest inside and outside Google, even before Israel’s war on Gaza.\nWhile Amazon has largely remained silent in the face of employee activism and outside scrutiny, Google routinely downplays or denies the military reach of Project Nimbus — despite the Israeli Finance Ministry’s 2021 announcement that the deal would service the country’s “defense establishment.”\nGoogle has also sought to reassure those concerned by its relationship with a government whose leadership is being investigated by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity by claiming Nimbus is constrained by the company’s general rules and regulations.\n“We have been very clear that the Nimbus contract is for workloads running on our commercial cloud by Israeli government ministries, who agree to comply with our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy,” a Google spokesperson told Wired in July and repeated verbatim to Time magazine in August, linking both times to the public-facing copies of each document.\nGoogle Cloud’s terms of service prohibit, among other things, uses that “violate, or encourage the violation of, the legal rights of others,” any “invasive” purpose, or anything “that can cause death, serious harm, or injury to individuals or groups of individuals.”\nBut the premise that Google policy dictates how Nimbus is used is called into question by a previously undisclosed email from a company lawyer. On December 10, 2020, before the tech giant won the contract, Google lawyer Edward du Boulay wrote to company executives with exciting news: “Google Cloud has been preparing to submit a bid for Project Nimbus (internal code ‘Selenite’), a competitive tender to provide cloud to the Israeli government. The business believes this is currently the largest government procurement of public cloud globally.”\nDu Boulay noted that “If Google wins the competition, we will need to accept a non negotiable contract on terms favourable to the government,” and “Given the value and strategic nature of this project, it carries potential risks and rewards which are significant if we win.” Among Du Boulay’s concerns is the fact that the Israeli “government has unilateral right to impose contract changes,” the lawyer warned. He cautioned further that should it win the contract, Google would retain “almost no ability to sue [Israel] for damages” stemming from “permitted uses … breaches.” The email does not explain what exactly would prevent Google from seeking legal recourse should the Israeli state commit such a breach.\nGoogle’s suggestion of authority over the contract are further undermined by Israeli governmental contract documents reviewed by The Intercept. The documents state that the company’s standard terms of service don’t apply — rather, an “adjusted” terms of service document is in effect.\n“The tenderer [Israel] has adjusted the winning suppliers’ [Google and Amazon] service agreement for each of the services supplied within the framework of this contract,” according to a 63-page overview of the Nimbus contract published to the Israeli government’s public contracting portal. “The Adjusted Terms of Service are the only terms that shall apply to the cloud services consumed upon the winning bidders’ cloud infrastructure.”\nGoogle spokesperson Atle Erlingsson told The Intercept “We’ve been very clear about the Nimbus contract, what it’s directed to, and the Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy that govern it. Nothing has changed.” Erlingsson declined to respond to the contract language about a separate, adjusted terms of service policy.\n\nThe language about “Adjusted Terms of Service” appears to contradict not only Google’s public claims about the contract, but also how it has represented Nimbus to its own staff. During an October 30 employee Q&A session, Google president of global affairs Kent Walker was asked how the company is ensuring its Nimbus work is consistent with its “AI Principles” document, which forbids uses “that cause or are likely to cause overall harm,” including surveillance, weapons, or anything “whose purpose contravenes widely accepted principles of international law and human rights.”\nAccording to a transcript of the exchange shared with The Intercept, Walker said that Nimbus is subject to Google’s own terms: “When it comes to the Nimbus contract, in particular, this is a contract that is designed and directed at our public cloud work, not at specific military classified sensitive information. It’s not designed for that. And everything that’s on our Cloud network, our public Cloud, is subject to our Acceptable Use Policy and our Terms of Service. So, you know, I can assure you that we take all this seriously.”\nThe Israeli contract document also seems to contradict another common defense of the contract from Google, echoed by Walker, that Nimbus is “not directed at highly sensitive, classified, or military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.” According to the Israeli contract document, however, the government “may make any use of any service included in the supplier’s catalog of services.”\nA separate document pertaining to Nimbus’s “Digital Marketplace,” a suite of third-party software hosted by Google and made available to Nimbus users in the Israeli government, offers another apparent contradiction: “There will be no restrictions on the part of the Provider as to the type of system and information that the Clients may migrate to the service, including vital systems of high sensitivity level.” This second document stipulates that the Israeli government “may make any use of the service within the performance of its function and purpose as a public service for the State of Israel and its citizens,” and that “there will be no restriction of any kind, including ‘permitted use’ rules for a service being offered in the governmental digital marketplace.”\nShould Google not have any meaningful control over Nimbus, the company could face consequences beyond public relations or employee dissent. In October, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territory placed a public call for information pertaining to private sector involvement in “the commission of international crimes connected to Israel’s unlawful occupation, racial segregation and apartheid regime,” according to a press release.\nThe Abolitionist Law Center, a Pennsylvania-based public interest firm, told The Intercept it is filing a submission detailing how “Google and Amazon Web Services’ provision of advanced technological services to the Israeli government through Project Nimbus violates — by its very nature — each companies’ purported commitments to human rights due diligence obligations,” according to staff attorney Sadaf Doost. “This is most evidently demonstrated by how the Project Nimbus contract itself includes a clause granting authority to Israeli officials to modify the companies’ standard terms of use agreements in ways that have not been made clear to the public.”\n",

    "text": "The signs appeared on the university’s main quad during the week of October 7, 2024 — after a year of student protests springing up nationwide against Israel’s war on Gaza.\nThe “Notice of Restrictions” posted at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill’s campus included a list of do’s and don’ts — mostly don’ts. Don’t wear masks to conceal one’s identity. Don’t throw any objects, besides those traditionally used for recreational purposes, like a frisbee. Don’t set up camp: “No temporary structures whatsoever, including but not limited to stages, tents, chairs, hammocks, tables, signs and displays.”\nDo carry a student ID if you need to access certain buildings.\nThe new rules appeared designed to stifle student protests, without explicitly saying as much.\n“It’s a vague threat for anyone who wants to organize, to anyone that wants to express their First Amendment rights,” said one UNC student who was arrested at an anti-war protest. The intent, they said, is to tell potential activists, “‘Hey, this is all the things that we can get you on, so you better not even try.’”\nBig public universities have historically been at the forefront of catalyzing activist movements, from the civil rights movement, to anti-Vietnam War protests to calls for divestment from apartheid-era South Africa. Now, these institutions are using legal action, disciplinary efforts, and campus rule changes to chill speech and dissent.\nAs a result, students may be risking their physical, academic, and long-term professional prospects simply for exercising their right to be heard.\nAt some of the country’s largest and most prestigious public universities — UNC–Chapel Hill; University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and the University of California, Los Angeles — first came the mass arrests, then came crackdowns on rules intended to suppress free speech and protests.\n“College students often have a really important role in social change in the country,” said Graeme Blair, a political science professor at UCLA, who was among UCLA faculty arrested at a spring protest. “The implications are pretty serious, not just for speech on Palestine, but for speech on other unpopular issues, which in many ways is the point of protests.”\nWhen asked to comment on disciplinary actions against protesters, neither UCLA nor UMass Amherst responded to inquiries.\nThe administration at UNC responded vaguely, writing that the school “supports the rights of all community members to demonstrate peacefully as part of their First Amendment rights. However, everyone must follow University policies, and we must enforce our policies and local/state laws equitably across the board, no matter the viewpoint.”\nAcross the country, protesters on college campuses have faced criminal charges including trespassing, failure to disperse, resisting arrest, and assault of government officials.\nAt UMass Amherst, more than 135 people — a mix of faculty, students and community members — were arrested on May 7. Thirty-six protesters were detained at the UNC–Chapel Hill, with six arrested, in April. At UCLA, police arrested 231 people during a six-week period from May to June.\nThe six arrested at UNC–Chapel Hill have been offered plea deals; however, a student who spoke with The Intercept on the condition they not be named refused to accept the offer. “That is justice without trial,” they said. “You don’t actually get to determine whether what you did was wrong, you are forced to come to that conclusion yourself without actual knowledge of the legal system.”\nNot all punishment takes the form of criminal charges. Demonstrators have faced academic probations, ranging from restrictions on participation in school organizations to putting degrees and academic records on hold, preventing students from graduating.\nThe UNC student said they’d been put on disciplinary probation, which required them to complete 30 hours of community service by September 1 and prevents them from joining club sports or participating in student government.\nStory Young, a student protester from UMass, said they were placed on poor disciplinary standing for disruptive behavior and unauthorized use of property. This standing serves as a warning that heftier consequences, such as suspension or expulsion, could occur if they were to get in trouble again.\nWith the threat of future punishment hanging over their head, Young finds it hard to take UMass’s motto seriously: “Be Bold. Be True. Be Revolutionary.”\nAt a hearing with the administration on October 25, Young was found guilty. They maintained in the appeal that they did not commit the infractions. Young suspects the administration won’t be swayed by the appeal, and said their goal in filing it was to take as much time as possible from an institution in which they have lost faith: “I see the administration now as nothing more than a business whose sole purpose is to extract everything it can from me.”\nKevin Young (no relation to Story Young), a tenured history professor at UMass Amherst and participant in the large on-campus protest in May, was arrested mere moments after serving as a faculty witness in a negotiations meeting between the administration and protest organizers, he said.\n“The students, understandably, felt like that was a betrayal of their trust,” he said. “Like the negotiations were not actually happening in good faith if the implication was that they would be arrested if they disagreed with the administration.”\nKevin Young said his participation felt like a way of showing support for his students.\nWhile charges against him were dropped with a limited probation that he said required individuals to avoid criminal charges for three months, he was investigated by the university and received a letter of warning from the administration on September 4.\nIn a write-up outlining the findings against Kevin Young, the UMass associate provost for academic personnel wrote: “Contrary to Professor Young’s contention that his remaining at the encampment would serve to protect students, I find that it set a very poor example for them. As an intellectual guide and counselor, it is reasonable to expect that our professors will counsel and guide students not to violate the law and University policy. Professor Young did not do that but rather modeled conduct that ultimately led to his arrest.”\n“What they kept saying to us is, and what they’re still saying today, is as faculty you need to use your influence to dissuade them from engaging in any disruptive activism,” Kevin Young said. “So that’s the way that they’re trying to utilize the faculty against the student organizers.”\nSimilarly, Blair, the UCLA professor, was forced to go through a disciplinary process after his arrest. He is suing the university alleging the violation of his First Amendment rights. He believes he was denied promotion to a full professor as a result.\n“In addition to the arrests, the university added insult to injury and decided to send every person who was arrested — students, faculty, and staff — through a disciplinary process, even though what they were doing was exercising their constitutional right to free speech,” Blair said.\nOne other faculty member and two graduate students have also sued the UC Regents.\n“They’re using the disciplinary system and the new set of rules to make life as difficult as possible so that they can dissuade people from coming out,” Blair said. “They’re not being successful in that but it is an extraordinary use of their power.”\nThe response on the UNC campus to the new rules has been mixed: Some community members are now hesitant to speak out, while others are fueled to fight back.\n“It’s unabashedly authoritarian, so I must laugh at it, right?” said the UNC student who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “You must laugh unless you cry.”\nThe goal of protests is simple, the student said; it’s to raise awareness for an injustice they can’t ignore. “The whole point about protesting is that it draws a spectacle, it draws the attention of everyone around them to say what is actually happening here, what are they protesting for,” the student said. “‘Oh, they’re protesting because there’s 40,000 dead.’”\nThe student said they are anxious about the increased security on campus but still intend to support the Palestinian solidarity movement and remain a member of Students for Justice in Palestine.\nSince the new regulations were announced, however, no encampments have been established on UNC’s campus, only a picket and various vigils. Earlier this month, about 150 protesters turned out at UCLA. Campus police arrested four of the demonstrators.\n",

Like everything else, deportations of the 21st century are an increasingly data-centric undertaking, tapping vast pools of personal information sold by a litany of companies.

He plans to use federal immigration police and perhaps the military to force millions of immigrants out of the United States in an operation the president-elect says has “no price tag.” While the country braces for the possibility of immigrants forcibly rounded up and deported, much of the undertaking will likely remain invisible — the domain of software analysis and database searches of unregulated personal data.\nRegardless of immigration status, it is nearly impossible to exist today without creating a trail of records. DMV visits, electricity bills, cellphone subscriptions, bankruptcy proceedings, credit history, and other staples of modern life all wind up ingested and repackaged for sale by data companies. Information like this has helped inform deportation proceedings under both Republican and Democratic leadership.\nIn 2021, The Intercept reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement paid LexisNexis nearly $17 million to access its database of personal information, which the company says includes 10,000 different data points spanning hundreds of millions of people in the United States. Within just seven months, according to documents reviewed by The Intercept, ICE had searched this database over 1.2 million times.\nSimilar uses of unregulated private data have become commonplace for immigration and border authorities. In 2020, Protocol and the Wall Street Journal reported on the extensive use of location and other personal data gleaned from smartphone apps by companies like Gravy Analytics and Venntel and resold to ICE and Customs and Border Protection. ICE “has used the data to help identify immigrants who were later arrested,” according to sources who spoke to the Journal.\nAnalytic software sold by Palantir has been instrumental to ICE’s deportation efforts; reporting by The Intercept showed the company’s tools were used in a 2017 operation targeting unaccompanied minors and their families.\nLast year, Motherboard reported CBP had purchased access to Babel Street software that “lets a user input a piece of information about a target—their name, email address, or telephone number—and receive a bevy of data in return,” including “social media posts, linked IP address, employment history, and unique advertising identifiers associated with their mobile phone.”\nTo see whether corporate America will support Trump’s promised anti-immigrant operation, The Intercept reached out to data and technology companies that hold immense quantities of personal information or sell analytic software useful to an agency like ICE. The list includes obscure data brokers that glean intimate personal details from advertising streams, mainstream cellular phone providers, household-name social networks, predictive policing firms, and more.\nThe list is by no means exhaustive. Private firms that quietly collect and sell personal data that could be of use to immigration authorities are innumerable and ever-growing. Some of these companies, like Meta, may not directly sell personal records to third-party customers in the manner of LexisNexis but could be asked to aid in immigration enforcement if presented with a legal request. At times, social media companies have opted to fight such requests they consider overly broad or invasive.\nIn 2016, as Trump prepared to begin his first term, The Intercept asked nine major tech firms whether they would help build a nationwide “Muslim registry,” as he had pledged during his campaign. Initially, only one — Twitter — even responded (the answer was no). Eventually, Facebook (as Meta was then known), Apple, Microsoft, and Google stated on the record that they too would not help build a computerized list of Muslims. The country now faces the prospect of another nationally polarizing MAGA campaign pledge, again with horrific civil liberties implications, and again requiring the aid or at least cooperation of one or many technology firms.\nAs in 2016, The Intercept posed the same question to each company, and requested a yes or no response: Would your company provide the Trump administration with data or other technical services to help facilitate mass deportation operations, either voluntarily, in response to a legal request, or via a paid contract?\nThis is how they responded.\n\nCorrection: December 3, 2024This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Near Intelligence and Azira are now separate legal entities.\n",

    "text": "The Biden administration is withholding federal funding from a climate justice group that supports a ceasefire in Gaza.\nThe Climate Justice Alliance, a national coalition of more than 100 community environmental groups, was one of 11 grant-making organizations designated for Environmental Protection Agency funding under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.\nThe Climate Justice Alliance is the only group of the 11 grantees that has engaged publicly on issues related to Palestine — and the only one that hasn’t received its funding.\nClimate Justice Alliance Executive Director KD Chavez said the organization, which was recently attacked by right-wing politicians and media, has been targeted because of its anti-war stance.\nPalestine is hardly a focus of the Climate Justice Alliance’s work, but past statements calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and denouncing apartheid in Palestine have come under a microscope amid a political climate that is increasingly hostile to any form of support for Palestinians.\n“Since our founding, CJA has been really clear in our position opposing war, racism, and colonialism,” said Chavez. “For us, there is a direct tie to carbon emissions and militarism, and we stand behind our environmental and climate justice work, which is going to mean that we are anti-war at heart.”\nDelaying the grant payment, which was first reported by E&E News, could set a broader precedent to withhold funding from organizations working on social justice issues, Chavez said. House Republicans recently passed a bill known as H.R. 9495 that critics say would green-light devastating political attacks on nonprofits.\n“If we are not funded, it could set a larger civil society precedent for any future federal funding for any ambiguously progressive organization in the future,” Chavez said. “When we’re connecting the dots, seeing H.R. 9495 gain traction plus the potential of us not being obligated these funds could lead to dangerous precedent setting for civil society more broadly.”\nA spokesperson for the EPA said the agency was still evaluating the Climate Justice Alliance grant. “EPA continues to work through its rigorous process to obligate the funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, including the Thriving Communities Grantmakers program,” EPA Communications Director Nick Conger said in a statement to The Intercept. “EPA continues to review the grant for the Climate Justice Alliance.”\nThe Biden administration announced the recipients of $600 million in grants under the program in December. The Climate Justice Alliance was one of three national grantees. Nine regional organizations were also selected.\nThe Climate Justice Alliance said it met all administrative deadlines and expected to get notice of funds by September, the end of the standard 90-day waiting period for grant applicants. Grantees under the program have to have their funds obligated by December 6 in order to get the funds disbursed before the start of the Trump administration.\nThe grant would support communities experiencing disproportionately heavy impacts of climate change by funding air- and water-quality sampling, cleanup projects, air quality monitoring, and building green infrastructure.\nIf the EPA decided not to issue the grant, the effects would fall disproportionately on working people, Chavez said.\n“This would be a political divestment from working class and marginalized communities,” Chavez said. “In its place, we would see the polluting of our public lands and neighborhoods by the fossil fuel industry.”\nIn a statement last year following the October 7 attacks, the Climate Justice Alliance called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and condemned “genocidal attacks by Israel on the civilian Palestinian population.” The alliance has also called on Congress to stop funding Israel’s military and denounced apartheid in Palestine as a climate justice issue resulting from the effects of war contaminating Palestine’s air, water, and soil.\n“This is about the GOP’s obsession with shutting down the EPA,” Chavez said. “The attacks that we’re seeing on us are collateral damage in a war against regulations that protect everybody.”\nRepublican lawmakers and right-wing media have targeted the Climate Justice Alliance in recent attacks. On Saturday, the Daily Caller published a story on the pending EPA grant that claimed that the Climate Justice Alliance shared protest material celebrating Hamas.\nThe Daily Caller also said the Biden administration was weighing “awarding taxpayer dollars to [a] nonprofit that wants to defund the police.” Earlier this month, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee issued a report criticizing the EPA program and claiming that the Climate Justice Alliance had exhibited “anti-Republican sentiment.”\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and his administration are preparing to gut groups working on environmental and economic issues affecting working-class people, Chavez said.\n“We’re going to be facing a lot of rollbacks in these next two to four years,” they said. “And we want to make sure that our communities are at least resourced in being able to mitigate the harm.”",

    "title": "Happy Native American Heritage Month From the Army That Brought You the Trail of Tears",
    "author": "Nick Turse",
    "date": "2024-11-28T05:15:00-05:00",
    "text": "To celebrate Native American Heritage Month, the Pentagon has gone all out with ceremonies across the United States, from an Air Force-sponsored intertribal powwow in Florida to a celebration of  Native American aircraft nose art in Oregon.\nThe military has also been pumping out feel-good stories about Native American troops: one South Dakota National Guardsman from the Oglala Sioux tribe was allowed to grow out his hair, and an Air National Guardsmen from the District of Columbia who belongs to four different tribes reflected in his Lakota, Seneca, Navajo, and Comanche heritage.\nThe top official involved in the commemorations, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, gave a speech calling this month “a time to remember the achievements of indigenous peoples throughout our nation’s history” and proceeded to begin that history with a reference to the Navajo “Code Talkers,” who used their native language to create an unbreakable code for U.S. Marines during World War II.\nThere is, however, quite a bit of history that Hicks’s historical timeline skips: roughly 170 years of armed attacks, forced relocations, ethnic cleansing, and even genocide of Native Americans carried out by the U.S. military.\n“Acknowledging Native veterans and Native contributions is terrific. And there are a lot of proud Native veterans. But it’s one of those gestures that is nice in theory but is, perhaps, meant to whitewash how we understand Native American history and how Native Americans ended up in the place that we did,” said Keith Richotte Jr., the director of the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program at the University of Arizona. “It doesn’t really address the fact that there was this longer history in which military violence was critical to the subjugation of Native peoples and maintaining the colonial project. It ignores the military’s efforts in the late 18th and 19th centuries to essentially destroy tribes, tribal nations, and tribalism.”\nAnother expert on the topic put it more bluntly.\n“The Army was, bottom line, an instrument of a settler colonial empire that was determined to convert Native lands into private property for mostly white settlers,” said Jeffrey Ostler, professor of history emeritus at the University of Oregon and author of “Surviving Genocide: Native Nations and the United States From the American Revolution to Bleeding Kansas.” “That was its mission: to carry out a federal government policy that, in practice, often became a genocidal war.”\nThe U.S. Army, formed in 1775, fought alongside and against Native Americans from its very founding.\nThis appears to be a mealy-mouthed reference to the fact that the Oneida Homelands were estimated at about between five to six million acres of land at the end of the Revolutionary War, but following a raft of federal and New York state treaties and rulings were reduced to 32 acres by the early 1900s. (The Pentagon did not reply to a request to interview the author of the piece.)\nThe nascent U.S. military was less generous to Native Americans who didn’t join their colonial rebellion and sided with the British.\nIn 1779, George Washington ordered a scorched-earth campaign to bring about the “total ruin” of Six Nations settlements across hundreds of miles of Pennsylvania and New York. “The immediate objects are the total destruction and devastation of their settlements and the capture of as many prisoners of every age and sex as possible. It will be essential to ruin their crops,” read the orders sent to Maj. Gen. John Sullivan. “Our future security will be in their inability to injure us the distance to which they are driven and in the terror with which the severity of the chastisement they receive will inspire.” When the operation was over, Sullivan’s army had destroyed more than 40 villages and at least 160,000 bushels of corn.\nThe Pentagon’s celebratory articles about Native Americans’ cheerful service in the U.S. military and glaring historical gaps are further undermined by more accurate information available — if tucked away — on the U.S. Army Center of Military History’s own website.\nThere, the Army chronicles 14 named “Indian Wars Campaigns” stretching from the 1790s to the 1890s. That official history is a triumphant story of “expeditions” against “restless” and “hostile Indians” who were seen as an “obstacle to expansion”; Native people who act “treacherously” and exhibit “unrest” in reaction to “an influx of miners, and extension of railroads”; the destruction of Indigenous villages leading to “rapid settlement” in new areas by whites; defeats of tribes “on the warpath”; Native leaders hanged and “killed resisting arrest”; and Indigenous people — including “squaws” and children — forced from their lands; all culminating in a slaughter at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, which even the Army’s history accurately portrays as a massacre:\nDespite the racism and brutality toward Native Americans evident in the Army’s official chronicle, many of its worst atrocities against Indigenous people are conspicuously absent from the account.\nIn 1838, for example, Gen. Winfield Scott issued orders, on behalf of President Martin Van Buren, for eastern Cherokees to leave their ancestral homeland. An estimated 17,000 were driven from their homes, sometimes at gunpoint with few or no possessions as white looters ransacked their homes. Many were also put into internment camps before being pushed westward to what is now Oklahoma; a military-enforced displacement that became known as the Trail of Tears. Cherokee authorities estimate that 6,000 men, women, and children died on the 1,200-mile march.\nAfter the Cherokee, the Army continued to forcibly displace other Native Americans. All told, around 88,000 people indigenous to the eastern United States were pushed westward in the 1830s and 1840s. Up to 19 percent died as a result.\nSome of the most egregious U.S. military violence against Native Americans occurred during the Civil War. During these years, President Abraham Lincoln’s forces reserved their most vicious treatment not for the traitorous Confederacy, but for members of Native American tribes, subjecting them to depredations far worse than those meted out against white southerners.\n“The Army’s mission could take different forms. Sometimes it could be removal. Sometimes they massacred people. It happened more in the American West than in the American East. But that basic template is there from the 1780s into the 1890s,” said Ostler. “The Army conducted surprise attacks designed to kill as many people as possible, including women and children, old men, babies. Everyone. This wasn’t out-of-control commanders. This was policy.”\nIn 1862, Col. James H. Carleton, the head of the U.S. Department of New Mexico, decided that Indigenous people must “give way to the insatiable progress of our race.” To that end, he issued orders to frontiersman Christopher “Kit” Carson: “All Indian men of [the Mescalero Apache] tribe are to be killed whenever and wherever you can find them.” Carleton issued similar orders for the Navajo, as well. Carson, as a result, conducted a scorched-earth campaign, burning villages, slaughtering livestock, destroying water wells, forcing the Navajo to surrender, and then subjecting them to a forced march over hundreds of miles to an internment camp. Thousands died as a result.\nIn 1863, the U.S. military committed one of its largest single-day atrocities to date, near what’s now Preston, Idaho. Col. Patrick Edward Connor employed four companies of cavalry, one of infantry, and artillery against the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation. “Kill everything!” he ordered. “Nits make lice.”\nThe U.S. troops went on a killing spree, shooting defenseless men, women, and children. Some troops reportedly raped women even as they lay dying while others used axes to bash in the heads of wounded children. By some counts, 250 Shoshone were slain, including 90 women and children. The tribe’s written history of the Bear River massacre estimates 350 deaths. Hans Jasperson, in his 1911 autobiography, said he walked among the corpses, counting 493 dead Shoshones. “I turned around and counted them back and counted just the same,” he wrote. Following the slaughter, Connor was promoted to brigadier general for his “heroic conduct.”\nAfter Gen. John Pope was bested by the Confederacy’s Robert E. Lee at the Second Battle of Manassas in August 1862, he was sent West to make war on Native people. “It is my purpose utterly to exterminate the Sioux if I have the power to do so,” he wrote. “They are to be treated as maniacs or wild beasts.” While attempting to hunt down Santees in 1863, Pope’s forces encountered camps of peaceful Yanktonai, Hunkpapa, and Sioux, many of whom they killed. One American witness to the campaign said forces under Pope did “what no decent man would have done,” noting that they slaughtered women and children in what he called a “perfect massacre.”\nIn the Nebraska Territory in 1863, a group of Ponca were confronted by Seventh Iowa Cavalry troops. Brandishing revolvers, they offered the Native women money for sex and were rebuffed. The Ponca women fled, but the next morning the Americans tracked them down and killed three women and a young girl. The U.S. government called it a “very unfortunate occurrence,” but the next year an official report noted that “the murderers of several of this loyal and friendly tribe” had not been punished.\nCol. John Chivington, the head of the Colorado military district, was another U.S. commander with a hatred for Indigenous people. “Damn any man who sympathizes with Indians!” he told his troops. “I have come to kill Indians, and believe it is right and honorable to use any means under God’s heaven to kill Indians.”\nFollowing numerous depredations by men under Chivington’s command, the “peace chief” Black Kettle of allied Cheyenne and Arapaho groups met with Army officers and negotiated a truce in September 1864.\nDespite this, Chivington declared “scalps are what we are after” and led more than 700 troops to attack Black Kettle’s camp at dawn on November 29, 1864. In what the colonel called “an act of duty to ourselves and to civilization,” his men unleashed gunfire and artillery on the sleeping village.\nIn testimony before members of the U.S. House of Representatives, John S. Smith, a U.S. government official, testified that he watched Chivington’s troops massacre hundreds at Sand Creek. Questioned by Massachusetts Republican Daniel W. Gooch and Charles R. Buckalew, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, Smith detailed the horrors:\nFor almost four hours, U.S. forces slaughtered the camp’s inhabitants, two-thirds of them women and children. Many Native women were also raped and mutilated, and Native American scalps, breasts, and genitalia  were taken as souvenirs. In an after-action report, Chivington wrote of “making almost an annihilation of the entire tribe” and then in a letter to Maj. Gen. Samuel Curtis stated: “It may, perhaps, be unnecessary for me to state that I captured no prisoners. Between five and six hundred Indians were left dead upon the field.” No court martial was ever convened, and no punishments were meted out in connection with the massacre.\n“I don’t think that your average person truly understands the levels of violence and coercion and destruction done to Native peoples and the direct involvement in the military in perpetuating that violence,” said Richotte. “A more honest telling of this history would, perhaps, force us to reckon with our understandings of that past.“\nOne hundred and sixty years after the Army failed to hold anyone accountable for hundreds of people massacred at Sand Creek, that service is honoring the “culture and heritage of Native Americans and Alaska Natives” by telling a story that, like Hicks’s history, begins with World War II.\nThe hidden history excised by the Army, which includes sporadic battles with small bands of Native Americans into the 20th century, is one of success in dispossessing Indigenous people. Today, the effort to wrest land from Native Americans — chronicled in the Army’s history of the “Indian Wars” — is complete. The amount of land Native tribes currently have compared to what they once possessed shrank by 98.9 percent, according to a 2021 study in the journal Science. In many cases, however, no comparison was even possible. Of the 380 tribes analyzed, 160 no longer had any federally or state-recognized land.\nWhile atrocities and forced displacement have been edited out of the Pentagon’s historical narrative, it is notable that numerous stories offered by the military this month still reference Native Americans’ struggles with outdated notions, racism, and cultural depredations. In one article, for instance, Sgt. 1st Class Lynette Eriacho, a soldier and member of the Navajo Nation, said she has “been asked whether Native Americans are all alcoholics, or if they still live in teepees.” Another piece offered up by the Army admonished troops and other Americans not to desecrate sacred sites and steal Native American artifacts.\nThe Pentagon has also shown a modicum of progress toward confronting its sordid past. This summer, the Defense Department announced that it will review the Medals of Honor given to 20 U.S. soldiers for carrying out the slaughter at Wounded Knee in 1890. The Pentagon did not respond to a request by The Intercept for the status of that review.\nThe Army also signaled that it will express regret for an 1869 terror campaign that included the shelling of a Lingít village near Wrangell, Alaska. In recent months, the Navy apologized “for wrongful U.S. military actions against Tlingit villages in Kake in 1869 and Angoon in 1882” — two communities packed with civilians that were devastated by U.S. attacks.\n“We need a reckoning with our past,” said Ostler. “All nations need to grapple with their past in order to create a just society.” The Pentagon did not respond to questions by The Intercept about criticisms of its Native American Heritage Month celebrations and its selective history of U.S. military interactions with Native people.\nRichotte called the Pentagon’s recent apologies to select Native people “a good start” but said it was only that: a start. “If it’s simply an acknowledgement, it’s hard to see it as quite enough. If all we’re left with is just words without some sort of additional meaningful action, then it seems to fall short of the promise of those types of acknowledgments in the first place,” he told The Intercept.\n“Colonialism benefits by making Indigenous peoples invisible,” said Richotte. “And as long as that remains the case — as long as the few markers of visibility are perpetuated under the colonizers — nothing is going to change.”",

Since then, universities have taken sometimes draconian measures to stop protests before they even begin.\nOn this week’s episode of The Intercept Briefing, Intercept reporters Akela Lacy and Jonah Valdez, who have been following the protest movements for months, discuss the latest developments and how college administrators are responding.\nLacy followed one such case at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where students were hit with severe charges for vandalism. “The school is trying to make an example of student leaders in the movement for Palestine to chill further speech,” Lacy says. “I want to emphasize the fact that these are felony charges for undergraduate students for a nonviolent offense that is putting paint on a building.”\nStudents and organizers who spoke with Valdez anticipate even greater hostility for protesters of every kind once Donald Trump takes office again in January. “This is what a lot of organizers were telling me leading up to Election Day was that there’s going to be so many other attacks on the rights of many other people,” he says, “whether it’s reproductive rights, rights of trans people, LGBTQ community at large, rights of immigrants, all on top of the ongoing genocide and occupation of Palestine.”\nTo hear more about the chilling effects on free speech and protest, listen to this week’s episode of The Intercept Briefing.",

    "text": "In the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip, Hajja Em Khalid listened to the news “night and day” on her small transistor radio — one of the few objects she opted to take with her when, displaced by the war, she left home.\nThe old-school radio had played Em Khalid the news, since the 1970s, of various Israeli crimes. It accompanied her through the many wars she had witnessed. The radio connects her with the world.\nFive of her siblings and four of her grandchildren were killed in December 2023 in an Israeli “belt of fire” — a term I grew up hearing in Gaza, a Palestinian version of “carpet bombing,” or an intense series of airstrikes meant to devastate local infrastructure.\n“Since the war began, I have obsessively followed the news,” she said. “Every time I had a reason to hope that I might again embrace my grandchildren, Israel’s announcements about progress in negotiations turned out to be a mirage.”\nIsraeli and Western leaders had claimed that Hamas head Yahya Sinwar’s assassination could mark a turning point in Israel’s war. The Biden administration, for example, had long described Sinwar as a barrier to achieving a ceasefire deal.\nWhen Sinwar was killed, President Joe Biden said it was an “opportunity” for a ceasefire. In a press conference shortly after the killing, however, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that the fight would go on: “The war, my dear ones, is not yet over.”\nIt was only the latest example of the Biden administration sending groundless signals that this brutal war is in its final chapters.\nUnwarranted optimism from the West, even if it is just a performance, has done no favors to the Palestinians who, for the most part, have themselves lost all reasons for hope.\nAnd while a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon was announced Tuesday night — negotiated as Israel intensified its strikes on Beirut — there remains no realistic hope for an end to the genocidal war on Gaza.\nAs a Palestinian from Gaza, watching politicians sell my people false narratives of hope over the last year has been painful. Western leaders are gaslighting us.\nEm Khalid thought, for instance, that Sinwar’s killing in October would end the onslaught on the besieged Gaza Strip — a notion pushed publicly by U.S. officials.\nShe said, “This was what Israel promised several times.”\nIn the end, the result was the same: no deal. Ceasefires, it seems, can work even for Lebanon, but Palestinians in Gaza are damned to mere hopes.\nAt the beginning of the Israeli ground offensive, I watched from my home in the north as thousands of leaflets fell from Israeli aircraft. They delivered orders telling us to evacuate to the so-called safe zones in the south.\nOn October 9, 2023, before we could even arrange to comply with the orders, Israeli fighter jets stormed overhead and bombed our densely populated neighborhood.\nMy arm was severely injured in the bombing. My mother, who worked at the United Nations, and my sister, who was a physiotherapist, were both killed.\nMy father, my surviving siblings, and I fled to the south. We thought we would be gone for a couple days, then be able to return home.\nLike thousands of displaced families in southern Gaza, we moved into a makeshift tent in November 2023 — freezing in the winter and hellishly hot in the summer.\nWhen after a few days, I proposed to my father that I build some shelves in our tent to make it more hospitable, my father reacted with indignation. “Are you crazy, Ahmad?” he admonished me. “It is only a matter of time. We will return in a couple of days.”\nWe lived with the constant fear of history repeating itself, that another Nakba was afoot. We did not know that the horrors we would live to tell about our present would dwarf those of the past.\nWe yearned to go back to where our home once stood, particularly to visit my mom’s and sister’s graves. The task may prove to be tragically impossible: The Israeli military has reportedly unearthed and moved many bodies from cemeteries in Jabalia.\nThe days in tents turned into months. In early March, on my father’s insistence, I left Gaza. My injured arm needed surgery and, with Gaza’s health infrastructure decimated, I needed to travel to Egypt.\nI took the only path there was out of Gaza. It’s now blocked. My family remains trapped, with seemingly no end to the war in sight.\nNo one in Gaza knows if they are going to be reunited with their family members abroad. I constantly ask myself: “When will I embrace my dad and siblings again?” And I follow news of every round of ceasefire talks, only to have my own hopes dashed when they inevitably lead nowhere.\nThe narratives put forward by American politicians and media have parroted, against all evidence, Israeli claims about the limits of its war effort.\nSpeaking to Fox News in November 2023, Netanyahu said, “We don’t seek to conquer Gaza, we don’t seek to occupy Gaza, and we don’t seek to govern Gaza.”\nThe current siege of northern Gaza, along with a raft of other military actions, belie his words.\nWhen Israel invaded Rafah in May, Netanyahu promised a “limited” operation against Hamas militants. At the time, the White House was projecting optimism about Cairo-based negotiations between Israel and Hamas; American officials took Israel at its word.\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, “What we’ve been told by our Israeli counterparts is that this operation … was limited and designed to cut off Hamas’s ability to smuggle weapons and funds into Gaza.”\nInstead of a targeted, limited campaign, what followed were annihilatory massacres.\nRafah, Gaza’s southernmost city and the once promised “safe zone,” had been turned into a dust-covered ghost town.\n“In Gaza, we thought that the Rafah ground offensive would lead to the end of the war because that is what Israel said worldwide,” Yosef, a 26-year-old university lecturer from Rafah, told me recently by phone. Yosef is currently living in a makeshift tent in Khan Younis, in southern Gaza.\n“The occupation authorities in Israel have been tormenting us with optimism,” he said. “They have been using hope to kill us. Now, hope is just another lethal tool that Israel is using against humanity in Gaza.”\nYosef added, “It’s more repugnant than their murdering bombs because you have to perish often rather than just once!”\nThe promises kept coming after Rafah. In August, Biden touted a forthcoming ceasefire: “We are closer than we’ve ever been.” According to reports at the time, however, Israel had made no reasonable concessions to give grounds to expect a deal. A senior Hamas official told the BBC that there had been no progress and that mediators were “selling illusions.”\nEven U.S. officials have acknowledged that optimism about an approaching ceasefire has been misplaced. “No deal is imminent,” one U.S. official, speaking anonymously, told reporters in September. “I’m not sure it ever gets done.”\nThe Israeli military commenced its ground assault into southern Lebanon in early October, again employing the falsehood that it would be a precise operation against Hezbollah militants. The “precise” operation has included strikes in densely populated areas and indiscriminate explosions of booby-trapped electronics, resulting in the killing of more than 3,500 Lebanese.\nOnly after months of violence and devastation in Lebanon was a ceasefire deal reached on Tuesday; it went into effect on Wednesday morning. In the final hours of negotiations, Israel ramped up missile strikes on the heart of Beirut.\nWhen I heard about the upcoming ceasefire in Lebanon, it called to mind the past deadly escalations by Israel on Gaza in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021 — just before temporary ceasefires went into effect. The ceasefires had brought feelings of euphoria, relief that we had survived. The break from the massacres, however, brought its own torments: taking stock of the massive destruction and loss.\nFor Palestinians from Gaza today, our feelings are again conflicted. We feel a relief for the people of Lebanon, who suffered violence for the sake of Gaza. We are also heartbroken that we are still being slaughtered. The Lebanon ceasefire is a reminder that we are still treated as subhuman.\nFollowing the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised in his campaign to bring lasting peace to the Middle East, some Palestinians I spoke with once again expressed hope for the end of the genocide. Trump, though, is Netanyahu’s closest political ally and friend.\nPalestinians like me, waiting in fear for our loved ones, are left in another state of terrifying uncertainty.\nWe can’t trust Israeli or American leaders when they talk about a ceasefire, and yet we still yearn for our own day to come, to experience those last hours before a ceasefire, when we might truly envision an end to the deadliest year in our recent history.",

    "title": "Take Out the Trash: A Proposal to Clean Up the Democratic Party",
    "author": "Sunjeev Bery",
    "date": "2024-11-18T05:00:00-05:00",
    "text": "The leadership of the Democratic Party deserves significant blame for the return of Donald Trump to the White House. While there were multiple factors at play, it must be acknowledged that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and their enablers engaged in vast levels of political malpractice despite countless warnings from many key voices and constituencies.\nMultiple governments worldwide, regardless of ideology, have suffered at the polls this year, suggesting that Harris faced an uphill battle no matter what. But that fight was made even more difficult by the simple reality that Biden and Harris spent a solid year alienating core constituencies of the Democratic Party, supporting Israel’s genocide in Gaza, and failing to assign clear blame for the individuals and interest groups responsible for the economic woes of the working class.\nIf we want a Democratic Party that can produce different outcomes, we will need to hold the current party accountable for its failures. That means matching our demands for change with the force and pressure of real accountability. The Democratic leadership must itself be targeted with campaigns that highlight the principles of electoral success while punishing those responsible for the party’s continued defeats. I’m building a campaign to do exactly that, and here’s how I think we can win.\nDemocrats are in disarray, with many different voices and communities picking through the wreckage of 2024 to decide what can be learned and what should be done next. This is the time to name our adversaries and assert our demands. If we want to build a Democratic Party that has any shot of winning elections and advancing the human condition, we must model the very posture of aggressive accountability that we want future Democratic presidential candidates to adopt.\nThere are plenty of potential targets for accountability. We can directly challenge the culture of the Democratic Party right now by turning the looming internal elections for a new Democratic National Committee chair into a public battle for our core values. Leaning into 2026, the elections for the House and Senate can be leveraged to call out Democratic incumbents who continue to serve as vehicles for corporate interests. Pro-Israel hawks like Rep. Ritchie Torres should be directly challenged in both the 2026 primaries and general election.\nLooking to 2028, leading Democratic contenders for the presidential race should be held accountable now for their failings. One such example is California Gov. Gavin Newsom. When Uber launched its successful war against California state-mandated benefits for drivers, Newsom stayed neutral. He should be called out for this silence. Another important target is Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is also being talked up as a presidential contender. Shapiro’s record of support for Israeli apartheid and genocide is well documented, and a grassroots campaign to oppose him as president should begin now.\nEven Biden’s eventual groundbreaking ceremony for his future presidential library should be made into a target for principled criticisms and protests. Biden destroyed the Democrats’ prospects in 2024 by supporting Israel’s genocide in Gaza and arrogantly refusing to drop out of the presidential race until it was too late to hold a real primary. By making an example out of Biden himself, we can “punch up” into the highest levels of the party and build our power to hold the party accountable.\nWhen it comes to the fundamental unfairness of the U.S. economy, Democrats often speak in soft surrogate terms: cutting taxes on the middle class, forgiving student loans, increasing funding for college, etc. But Democrats’ core silence on corporate greed has allowed Trump to step into the vacuum with a very different explanation of who is to blame. Trump’s false explanations often focus on racial resentments, culture conflict, or issues related to gender and sexuality. But blaming undocumented immigrants, DEI, “critical race theory,” or transgender equality will not address the fundamental unfairness of an economy in which workers are squeezed under the diktat of economic elites.\nThe American working class has long been undermined by those who represent the interests of concentrated wealth. America’s corporate elites block unions, outsource U.S. jobs, cut benefits, and squeeze as much profit as they can out of America’s workers. But Democratic presidential candidates rarely run campaigns that bluntly name and shame these elites for the damage that they do to working-class lives. The simple reason why is that many state- and national-level Democrats depend on these same financial elites for the cash that fuels politicians’ expensive campaigns.\nAs president, Biden brought into his administration a range of people and policies from the Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing of the party, which resulted in policies and actions that have been pro-union, anti-inflation, and anti-monopoly. But unlike Sanders and Warren, Biden has done a very poor job of using his bully pulpit to bluntly name and blame the individuals and interest groups who are often most responsible for working-class woes. Biden had some of the right policies, but for reasons that likely included age-related fatigue and ideological predisposition, he got the politics wrong.\nWhen Democrats create a “blame vacuum” for why working-class voters are suffering, other political opportunists are more than happy to step in. Thanks to the seduction of Trump, the white working class had already largely abandoned the Democratic Party. Now nonwhite working-class voters are starting to do the same. To reverse these trends, Democrats must start assigning blame accurately for the high prices, long workdays, and stagnant wages that harm so many workers in our country.\nNot only is the senior leadership of the Democratic Party unwilling to accurately name the enemy, but in many cases, the Democratic Party is actually run and advised by the same corporate elites who benefit from the exploitation of the American working class. The current chair of the DNC is Jaime Harrison, a former lobbyist for Walmart, Bank of America, Lockheed Martin, the coal industry, and many other corporate interests.\nAnother toxic example of the pervasive corporate control of the Democratic Party is Tony West, the brother-in-law of Kamala Harris. In 2024, West took a leave of absence from his role as senior vice president and chief legal officer for Uber to advise Harris on her presidential campaign. During West’s time at Uber, the company waged an all-out war against working-class interests by using a California ballot proposition to successfully gut state-mandated benefits for overworked and underpaid Uber drivers. And before West came to Uber, he served as general counsel at PepsiCo, a company that has profited heavily from price inflation.\nIt has been widely reported that West advised Harris to embrace wealthy corporate elites instead of blaming them for America’s economic woes. This disastrous advice led Harris to cater to high-net-worth interests and muddle her message. This may have helped Harris attract the $1.6 billion in contributions that backed her campaign, but her lack of a clear message on the economy left her with millions fewer votes than Biden received in 2020. She failed to energize the Democratic Party base, including working-class voters, and she lost her campaign.\nBill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama all have a long history of undermining progressive and populist movements in the Democratic Party. All three should be greeted by Democrats with the same deep skepticism that Trump supporters have shown George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Instead, they are still showered with deference and reverence by many.\nIn different ways, all three have aligned with the very corporate and financial elites who should be named as our political enemies. Bill Clinton brought us NAFTA, the job-destroying free-trade agreement that was opposed by labor unions. Hillary Clinton served on the board of Walmart and voted for Bush’s disastrous Iraq War. Obama avoided naming and shaming the Wall Street elites most responsible for the recession that brought him into power. And while in power, Obama bailed out financial institutions instead of focusing on working people.\nOnce out of office, these three senior Democratic Party voices have continued to undermine the possibility of a successful Democratic Party that can mobilize its base and appeal to the working class. In 2020, Obama intervened behind the scenes to block Sanders’s campaign for president and put the aging, arrogant, and politically inept Biden in the Oval Office, an intervention that essentially set the stage for Trump’s return to power. Obama also wrote the script for bragging about America’s increased oil and gas production, a posture that both Biden and Harris would later adopt as they, too, alienated climate voters. And this year, the Clintons and Obama all gaslit the Democratic voters most concerned about Biden’s support for Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Hillary Clinton heaped scorn upon Gaza activists, Bill Clinton personally justified Israel’s slaughter, and Obama tried to defend Biden by implying that Trump’s Muslim ban would be worse.\nUltimately, the former leaders of the Democratic Party are given far too much credit for their political successes. It is worth remembering that every Democrat who has been successfully elected president in the last 50 years came into office with the benefit of a massive disaster that undermined the Republican incumbent. Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush in 1992 thanks to a recession. Obama defeated the successor to George W. Bush, John McCain, thanks to another recession. And Biden defeated Trump with the help of the 2020 global pandemic. Even Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford in 1976 in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Watergate, and Ford’s unpopular pardon of Richard Nixon.\nAs Israel accelerates its ethnic cleansing and genocide of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, Democratic Party support for Israel’s military will continue to splinter and break apart the Democratic base. It will take time to more deeply investigate the question of why as many as 10 or 11 million of Biden’s 2020 voters didn’t show up to support Kamala Harris in 2024. But it is likely that some percentage of those voters were deeply anguished by Biden and Harris’s full-fledged support for U.S. military funding for Israel. Despite the misrepresentation of mainstream media, this anguish is not limited to Arab and Muslim voters, nor is it limited to voters in Michigan.\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee and other pro-Israel campaign and advocacy organizations all care little about the prospects of the Democratic Party. They are single-issue organizations that are happy to reward or defeat any elected official who stands with or against them. By keeping a home for single-issue pro-Israel networks in the Democratic Party, the party hollows itself out by allowing those same networks to push out prominent progressive and populist legislators, along with the voters who back them.\nOne ugly result of this is the emergence of an extraordinarily hollow form of representational politics. While anti-worker Black voices like Harrison and West take on informal and formal leadership roles in the party, populist and progressive Black members of Congress like Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman are targeted for defeat by the very pro-Israel networks who back Biden and Harris. Even the supposedly “pro-Israel, pro-peace” J-Street contributed to Bowman’s defeat.\nUntil Citizens United is overturned and public financing is embraced, the Democratic Party will face a perpetual tension between populist aspirations and the interests of corporate wealth. And even if major reforms were somehow implemented, they would pose such a threat to the interests of concentrated wealth that there would be a well-funded backlash.\nThis means that advocates for a more effective Democratic Party should embrace a permanent battle for the soul of the party. The Democratic Party needs a permanent watchdog community that is armed with sweeping campaigns for reform in order to combat the party’s perpetual slouch toward the interests of concentrated wealth. If you agree, consider joining me by signing on to this platform.\nMany networks both inside and outside the Democratic Party are well-poised to help lead calls for reform. Disgruntled Democrats, climate voters, progressives, opponents of Israel’s genocide, and even Green Party and Democratic Socialists of America members can all help push the Democratic Party away from its corporate moorings and pro-Israel litmus tests.\nWithout strong and sustained public pressure, the Democratic Party is likely to remain trapped in its culture of defeat. We shouldn’t expect any real changes from the current stewards of a broken political party. If we want a Democratic Party that wins elections and advances the public interest, we will have to start fighting for it. That fight needs to begin now.",

    "title": "Biden Has “Pardoned” Eight Turkeys. Will He Spare the Lives of 40 Human Beings?",
    "author": "Liliana Segura",
    "date": "2024-11-27T11:27:50-05:00",
    "text": "Five days after Orlando Hall was executed in the federal death chamber, Donald Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden for the 2020 Thanksgiving turkey pardon ceremony. The enormous white birds, Corn and Cob, stood ridiculously as Trump wished them a “very long, happy, and memorable life.” At the Special Confinement Unit inside the U.S. penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, men on death row watched news coverage on TV.\nIt felt like a sick joke. “He could have used his pardon/clemency powers to spare any one of the five human beings facing imminent execution,” one man later wrote to me. But the executions that had started that summer showed no signs of slowing down. Some who had watched their neighbors taken to die over the previous months still dared to hope that the next man, Brandon Bernard, might be spared. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” one of them wrote a week later. “Perhaps President Trump will show an uncharacteristic display of humanity.”\nBut there would be no such display. By the time Joe Biden arrived in the Oval Office in 2021, 13 people had been killed in the federal death chamber. It was an unprecedented killing spree: more executions over six months than over the previous 10 presidential administrations combined.\nCollectively, the 12 men and one woman executed in Terre Haute had been convicted of heinous crimes. But they also revealed the ugly face of the federal death penalty, which is wrongly assumed to apply only to terrorists or mass murderers — the ultimate “worst of the worst.” Most were human beings whose lives had been indelibly shaped by childhood abuse and neglect. Many had lawyers who disastrously failed them. Others had an intellectual disability or severe mental illness. More than one swore he was innocent; another was executed despite playing a marginal role in the crime that sent him to die. One man was executed over the loud objections of the victim’s family.\nThe executions were pushed through lawlessly, in the first year of the Covid pandemic, long before a vaccine was available. Prison staff, attorneys, journalists, a spiritual adviser, and the condemned men themselves contracted the virus as the executions went on — an emblem of Trump’s recklessness, chaos, and cruelty.\nBut in truth, the executions were also the result of a long bipartisan project, much of it led by Biden himself. It was not just that Democrats were responsible for dramatically expanding the federal death penalty, although that is certainly true. Of the 13 people executed by Trump, 10 had previously filed a clemency application to the Obama administration. His refusal to act set them up for execution.\nNow a growing chorus of people is urging Biden not to make the same mistake. “We’re dealing with a very different world this time,” said veteran death penalty lawyer Ruth Friedman, head of the Federal Capital Habeas Project. “People know this is a possibility because they see what has played out.”\nWith just 54 days before he leaves the White House, Biden’s window for using his clemency power is rapidly closing. A majority of the 40 people on federal death row have filed requests for their death sentences to be commuted to life. While the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney processes applications and makes recommendations, the president can also unilaterally grant clemency to whomever he sees fit.\nHundreds of advocacy organizations, from the American Civil Liberties Union to the Catholic Mobilizing Network, have called on Biden to grant mass commutations to everyone on federal death row. The abolitionist group Death Penalty Action, which protested each execution in Terre Haute, is urging Biden to demolish the death house as well. The flurry of letters and petitions cite reasons ranging from persistent evidence of racial bias — the majority of those on federal death row are people of color — to a lack of evidence that the death penalty deters crime. Public support for the death penalty has also steadily dropped for years; at the time of Trump’s execution spree, it had reached historic lows. The well-documented risk of executing innocent people is at least one explanation.\nBiden, of course, knows all of this. When he ran for president on an anti-death penalty platform in 2020, his plan for criminal justice reform cited death-row exonerations as one reason he would fight to pass legislation to end the federal death penalty. Those under a federal death sentence “should instead serve life sentences without probation or parole,” it said. Many are simply asking Biden to make good on this vow.\nBut the most pressing reason for Biden to act is the cost of doing nothing. There is no reason to doubt that Trump will continue what he started on his way out of the White House. Along with his repeated vows to expand the death penalty, the road map laid out in Project 2025 includes “finality” for the remaining 40 people on federal death row. The only way to guarantee that Trump is unable to push through another execution spree is to commute the sentences of those who remain.\nFour years before the Trump administration executed him around Thanksgiving, Orlando Hall had appealed to President Barack Obama for clemency. When I met his partner Shanyce Matthews weeks after his execution, she told me her family had been thrilled when Obama won the 2008 election. Although he supported the death penalty, she found herself hopeful that Hall might stand a chance to have his sentence commuted.\nShe knew it was a long shot. There was no denying that Hall’s crime was horrific. In 1994, he and a group of men abducted, raped, and murdered a 16-year-old girl named Lisa René in Arlington, Texas — part of a botched drug operation that spiraled violently out of control. Hall became one of the first men sentenced to die under the 1994 crime bill.\nNonetheless, there were serious problems with his case. Hall, who was Black, was convicted and sentenced to die by an all-white jury who remained unaware of critical elements of his life story. Like so many people who end up on death row, Hall had survived harrowing childhood trauma. Case records included sworn declarations from family and neighbors who described alcoholism, domestic violence, and deprivation; a local pastor remembered one of Hall’s siblings asking if he and his wife would be willing to adopt her. Such evidence can make the difference between life and death in a capital trial. But Hall’s attorneys failed to fully investigate and present this side of their client’s life.\nHall changed during his 25 years on death row. His children described him as a caring and supportive father and grandfather. A longtime pen pal described his love of reading and his expressions of deep remorse. One of his lawyers later wrote that she would have given him a room in her house if she’d ever had the chance.\nMatthews, who had known Hall since they were children, saw the change up close. He forged a strong relationship with their son and supported her work as a community organizer. “He believed in me,” she said.\nMatthews witnessed the execution. Apart from the horror of watching Hall murdered by lethal injection, she was struck by the forced attempt at normalcy by the Bureau of Prison staff, who made polite small talk as they escorted her to watch him die. Matthews refused to play along. “They said, ‘Is there anything we can do for you?’ And I said, ‘You can let him go.’ ‘Oh, unfortunately we’re not the people who make that decision.’”\nHall’s execution implicated every one of them, she said. “You are playing a part in this. … What is going to happen when you have to stand and answer for the things that you participated in?”\nOn Monday, Biden stood in the White House Rose Garden as he has for the past three years, accompanied by a pair of turkeys named Peach and Blossom. He recited the names of the previous turkeys he’d pardoned — a total of eight overall — and then joked about Peach and Blossom’s favorite songs, which ostensibly include Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ on a Prayer.”\n“Well fellas, your prayer’s gonna be answered today,” Biden said. He then “pardoned” the birds “based on your temperament and your commitment to being productive members of society.”\nIn Terre Haute, some of the same men who watched the ceremony on TV in 2020 once again face the prospect of their own execution. They are not asking for a pardon. They are not even asking for forgiveness for their crimes. They are asking to be spared the torture of being strapped to a gurney and killed in front of gawking strangers. They are asking for a chance to spare their loved ones the trauma of their execution. And they are asking for Biden to follow through on what he claimed to believe before he won the presidency.\nThere is no time to waste. As Matthews told me four years ago, “I think we have to start yelling about it, because to me what’s happening is we’re waiting until these guys get a date. And then the time moves so fast.”",

    "title": "Biden Made “Record Time” on Worker Protections for Heat. Trump Could Quickly Stamp Them Out.",
    "author": "Matt Sledge",
    "date": "2024-11-25T13:22:48-05:00",
    "text": "Most regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration go unnoticed, but this one caught the public’s attention.\nAs the Northern Hemisphere suffered through another hottest summer on record, OSHA issued draft rules meant to protect workers from extreme heat.\nThe rules are three years in the making, so far, but are likely to stall out within days after January 20. Worker advocates expect the rule to be placed in cold storage once Donald Trump takes power.\nIt will be another example of how, in the face of hostile courts, ambivalence within their own party, and a rulemaking process designed to fail, Democratic administrations claiming the mantle of worker rights have fallen short on rebuilding worker power.\nTime and again, said James Goodwin, policy director at the Center for Progressive Reform, sympathetic administrations have nonetheless taken years to issue new worker safety rules.\n“OSHA is just such a politically reviled agency that you can hardly fault them for being just this cautious,” Goodwin said. “With unions being so weak, OSHA doesn’t have many friends on the Hill these days. Nobody goes to bat for them.”\nTwenty years ago, a worker named Asunción Valdivia collapsed in a California field after more than 10 hours of picking grapes in the heat. His death later that day was a sign of things to come.\nReliable statistics are elusive, but dozens to perhaps hundreds or thousands of American workers die every year from exposure to excessive heat.\nAware that human-caused climate change is making the situation worse, the Biden administration followed state worker protection agencies in floating a heat protection rule in August 2021.\nFor employers in certain sectors such as construction, maritime, and agriculture, the rule would require employers to craft plans for extreme heat, including providing drinking water and break areas, and above a 90-degree heat index, mandatory rest breaks.\nThe rule had rare public appeal, Goodwin said. More and more people are aware of companies exposing workers to brutal temperatures — like the Amazon warehouse a decade ago that had a private ambulance on standby during a heat wave.\n“If ever there was an OSHA rule to really capture the public’s attention, this is it,” he said. “We’re all familiar with these huge Amazon warehouses and stuff. It’s easy to appeal to the public’s moral imagination with this rule.”\nThe rule could protect the millions of workers in private industry who do not have protection at the state level. In creating the rule, however, the Biden administration had to follow a labyrinthine federal process.\nTo put the regulation into effect, the Biden administration had to shepherd the rule through an advance notice of rulemaking, a comment period, a virtual stakeholder meeting, a working group, a small business review panel, and an advisory committee.\nSome steps apply to all federal agencies, while others such as the small business panel have been applied only to agencies like OSHA that are particularly reviled by Republican-majority Congresses.\nIn the case of the heat rule, the process consumed nearly three years.\nIn July, OSHA published a draft version of the rule preceded by hundreds of pages explaining why it was necessary. Comments on the proposed rule are due by the end of December, which normally would lead to another round of public hearings before a final rule.\n“They could probably have had a final rule out by 2026, if an administration was very focused on doing that,” said Rebecca Reindel, director of occupational safety and health for the labor federation AFL-CIO.\nInstead, the U.S. is getting Trump. Most likely, the next administration will simply halt work on the heat rule, according to Jordan Barab, who served as the deputy assistant secretary of labor for OSHA under Barack Obama.\n“The easiest thing and probably most likely thing to happen is they won’t work on it for four years,” Barab said.\nBarab spoke before Trump announced his selection of Lori Chavez-DeRemer as the next secretary of labor, a position that oversees OSHA. The Republican representative from Oregon was one of the few Republicans in Congress to support efforts to make union organizing easier. Labor advocates believe she represents a wild card in the traditional Republican tendency to roll back worker safety rules, as Trump did in his first term.\nGoodwin, however, said he expects little progress to be made on worker safety rules.\n“Chavez-DeRemer — like every other Trump nominee — has been brought in to serve as a transmission belt for translating conservative ideology into on-the-ground reality — not to bring her independent judgment to bear,” Goodwin said in an email. “And that means the heat rule would go.”\nRepublican administrations have generally tried to slash OSHA’s budget even further below the current level, which hypothetically would allow OSHA to visit every workplace in the U.S. once every 186 years, according to the AFL-CIO.\nThe staffing declines hit not only inspections, but also the offices responsible for crafting new rules such as the heat exposure standard.\nIf a more worker-friendly administration takes power in 2029, it could take the heat rule off the shelf and continue work, Reindel said. If that happens, it would continue a pattern of major worker safety rules grinding through the process for at least two Democratic administrations.\nOne major rule, on silica dust, took 45 years to go into effect. Barab said that compared to other rules, the heat standard was actually proceeding quickly.\n“Had we had another Democratic administration to work on it, it might have been finished a couple years from now,” Barab said. “So five years, to do a major standard like that would have been pretty much record time for OSHA these days.”\nGoodwin said he believes that Democratic administrations are cautious about passing OSHA rules too quickly because they could be tossed out by a judiciary increasingly hostile to worker rights on the slimmest pretext.\nFor that reason, he saw little reason for OSHA to try and pass a final heat exposure rule in the few weeks before Trump takes office.\n“I don’t know what the hell OSHA can do right now that would survive judicial review, with this current judiciary,” Goodwin said. “Maybe there’s an argument to be made for just ‘flood the zone,’ but the huge disparity in advocacy power between those who are fighting on behalf of workers and those who are fighting on behalf of management, I am not sure that flooding the zone even works.”\nThe glacial progress on the heat rule took place against a larger backdrop of a Biden administration that was friendly toward labor unions, but failed to get some of their highest priorities through Congress.\nWithout unions, advocates say, workers are far less likely to report safety violations. Senate Democrats never fully coalesced around labor’s top goal, a bill that would have made organizing labor unions easier. That meant that while the bill passed the House when Democrats controlled the lower chamber in 2021, it never got past the Senate filibuster.\nAnother bill more narrowly targeted at improving OSHA’s ability to crack down on safety violations got less momentum than the organizing bill, even under a fully Democratic Congress.\nStymied at the federal level, workers have turned to labor agencies in Democratic states to protect them. Five states have passed rules guaranteeing workers to water, rest, and shade.\nFor the next four years, the states may be the only place where workers can find relief, Reindel said.\n“Big business and corporate interests and billionaires have really pushed back on OSHA trying to protect workers and workplaces,” Reindel said. “We need to be very concerned about what that means for the state of this agency and for its ability to protect workers from dangerous working conditions.”",

    "text": "The nation’s largest private prison company, the GEO Group, has seen its stock soar in the weeks since Donald Trump’s election in anticipation of new contracts linked to mass deportation.\nTrump’s new choice for U.S. attorney general, Pam Bondi, worked as GEO’s lobbyist as recently as 2019. Her list of corporate clients also includes Amazon, the tech giant currently embroiled in an antitrust fight with the federal government.\nTrump announced his selection of Bondi, the former Florida attorney general, hours after another loyalist of his, Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration Thursday under growing scrutiny of allegations that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl.\nBondi will bring her own baggage to the nomination process in the form of a long list of clients she maintained at the powerhouse D.C. lobbying firm Ballard Partners, which also included the Qatari government, General Motors, and the Florida Sheriffs Association, among others.\nOne critic of the revolving door between politics and lobbying said Bondi’s work for those firms exemplified “the maturation of the political strategy of corporate America and our oligarch class” to spread even more money around beyond campaign donations.\n“Pam Bondi surely did work for these clients the past four years, but some of the economic calculus of hiring was for an eventuality like what we’re experiencing, even if the highly placed job of attorney general may not have been foreseen specifically,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project.\nIn 2019, Bondi was part of a team lobbying the White House and Department of Homeland Security on behalf of the GEO Group, according to a disclosure form filed with the U.S. House of Representatives. Bondi was already a star in the conservative legal world and had served on Trump’s transition team three years before.\nThe GEO Group stands to benefit handsomely if Trump’s proposed mass deportations swell the population at its facilities. In one recent corporate earnings call, company officials said it stood to make $400 million extra in revenue per year. The company’s stock has soared more than 100 percent since the day before the election.\nThe exact nature of Bondi’s work for the GEO Group is not disclosed in the lobbying forms, which downplay the company’s role in shaping immigration policy.\nAccording to the form, the company’s lobbyists are involved in “promoting the use of public-private partnerships in correctional services, including evidence based rehabilitation programs aimed at reducing recidivism. GEO does not advocate for or against criminal justice policy related to the criminalizing certain behaviors or length of criminal sentences, nor does GEO take a position on immigration enforcement policies or detention policies.”\nIn addition to immigration detainees, the GEO Group’s jails also hold people awaiting criminal trial. The Justice Department was previously an important client for the GEO Group, which operated detention facilities on behalf of the U.S. Marshals Service. In January 2021, President Joe Biden issued an order for the federal government to stop using private prison contracts, though The Intercept reported that the company found ways to keep their contracts alive.\nBondi’s work for two Silicon Valley titans – Amazon and Uber – provides some indication of her approach to the aggressive antitrust stance taken by the Biden administration.\nGaetz was viewed with alarm by Democrats, who said he was unqualified and poised to turn the Department of Justice into a tool of revenge for Trump.\nStill, he also had been greeted with wary optimism by progressives focused on breaking up corporate monopolies, who pointed to Gaetz’s pro-antitrust stance.\nThe Department of Justice’s antitrust division is a key arm of the government’s antitrust enforcement mechanism, with the staffing and statutory authority to take on big corporations. Under the Biden administration, it has sued Apple, Google, and Live Nation-Ticketmaster, alleging that those companies operated illegal monopolies in their respective markets.\nAmazon, Bondi’s client, faced a separate antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission.\nWhen Bondi was tapped to help defend Trump against his first round of impeachment charges in 2019, White House officials dismissed the idea that her client roll posed a conflict of interest.\n“She’s not here to lobby. She’s here to make sense about how in the world we’re going to impeach or remove a democratically elected president,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said at the time.\nA Trump transition spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n",

    "text": "Earlier this month, voters in California rolled back a number of criminal justice reforms on the ballot. Los Angeles ousted District Attorney George Gascón, who had been elected on pledges to end cash bail and prioritize violent crime. San Francisco reelected District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, who oversaw a spike in crime in her first year in office after replacing Chesa Boudin after his 2022 recall.\nThe conventional wisdom came together quickly: “Public safety” had won the day. Crime was up, and reforms were out. Initial takeaways from the results concluded that voters were getting “serious on crime” and proclaimed that the reform push was dead.\nIn Alameda County, California, the local prosecutor, Pamela Price, who had also pledged to end cash bail and let low-level offenses go uncharged, was ousted in her race — but not because of a huge spike in crime. Oakland, the most populous city in Alameda County, saw a 33 percent drop in homicides this year.\nContrary to the prevailing narrative, the fate of criminal justice reforms throughout the state is more complicated than it seems. California is experiencing historically low levels of crime statewide. Apart from the homicide spike that affected cities and rural areas around the country during the Covid-19 pandemic, crime in California has been relatively steady since the late 1990s.\nIt was a major shift. In recent years, California had been a bastion of reform. Last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the closure of death row at San Quentin State Prison. Legislators passed the Racial Justice Act in 2020, a landmark bill that made it easier to challenge criminal convictions based on evidence of racial bias. And, that same year, Los Angeles voters approved a ballot measure to radically transform the jail system and allocate funding to alternatives to incarceration.\nSo what changed? Voters had certainly been primed with sensational coverage of shoplifting sprees and horror stories blaming reform-minded DAs for letting offenders off the hook. And outsized spending from corporations, real estate interests, and tech investors helped opponents of reform get their message out.\nMoney, though, wasn’t the only factor in ousting Price and Gascón or leading voters to oppose abolishing slave labor in prisons, said Anne Irwin, founder and director of the criminal justice policy advocacy group Smart Justice California.\n“What’s really happening here is the housing crisis and the prevalence of unhoused people on the streets up and down California is creating for people a psychological sense of disorder, which will absolutely, inevitably make them feel unsafe,” Irwin said. “And unless and until we begin to really meaningfully solve our housing crisis and our homelessness crisis, it will be very hard to make Californians feel safe.”\n“And the question now is, how should we respond? How can we make voters feel safe and actually be safe?” she said. “We have to meet voters where they are and first and foremost, acknowledge their feelings, especially fear.”\nPeople’s fears, whether rooted in personal experience or influences like news media and ad campaigns, can’t be explained away with data, Irwin said. Whether unfounded or not, people need those feelings validated.\n“If we ignore or downplay those feelings, we will lose voters. And we have lost voters because we have downplayed their feelings.”\nIn Alameda County, voters who had elected reformer Price as district attorney just two years earlier chose to recall her, an effort that began taking root before Price was elected.\nShortly after Price won her election in 2022, some of the same donors who funded Boudin’s recall shifted their sights to Alameda. They launched a recall campaign just seven months after she took office. In an April interview with The Intercept, Price said wealthy investors funding the recall got involved to protect real estate interests in downtown Oakland.\nOn Monday, Price conceded the recall results and released a statement listing her accomplishments in office. She touted her prosecutions of murders and violent crimes, which she said came at a higher rate than her predecessor, as well as charges she brought against police for homicide. (The campaign against the recall declined the comment and pointed to Price’s statement.) Those accomplishments, however, hadn’t been enough.\nThe opposite tack — taking “tough-on-crime” positions — has failed too. The mainstream of the Democratic Party has tried to assuage voters’ fears around crime and safety, but the strategy served to boost opponents of reform, who tend to repeat the same claims sensationalizing crime whether it’s up or down.\nNow, just as national Democrats are wrestling with their messaging failures, criminal justice policy advocates are grappling with the fact that plying people with facts isn’t enough to win elections.\nAcknowledging where reformers can learn from their mistakes is not the same as capitulating to people who want to bring back the failed strategies of mass incarceration, said Jessica Brand, a strategist who works with reform DAs around the country, including Gascón, the Los Angeles DA who lost his reelection bid by more than 20 points.\n“We as a progressive movement need to work harder to implement the robust solutions that actually respond to people’s fears and concerns. These are also, by the way, solutions that we morally need,” Brand said. “That solution is not mass incarceration — it’s supportive housing and actual treatment beds and economic support.”\nPeople turn to the solutions that are readily available even if they no longer work, Brand added, “but we can’t just say those things in places where the problems are prevalent — we have to actually address them or else many people will resort to what they know, and that’s jail and prisons.”\nTrends in other parts of the country show that people are still open to reform, as long as it’s packaged in a way that gives people a sense of accountability for crime when it does occur, said Irwin of Smart Justice California. The dynamic was apparent in the campaigns of Proposition 36, which increased sentences for low-level crimes, and Nathan Hochman’s successful bid to unseat Gascón.\n“When the proponents of Proposition 36 or Nathan Hochman began to run their races, they pretty quickly realized that while voters want accountability and they want things to change, they do not actually want a wholesale return to mass incarceration,” Irwin said. “That is why Proposition 36 proponents pivoted from their early messaging, which focused on a real tough-on-crime framework, to a ‘mass treatment’ rhetoric.”\nHochman ran as a candidate who was “‘warm to reform,’” Irwin said, adding, “This is a person who had been a lifelong, ‘tough-on-crime’ Republican until just weeks before he filed to run in the attorneys race.” (Hochman’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)\nIrwin noted that the election was not a clean sweep for “tough-on-crime” opponents of reform.\n“That actually didn’t play out at all in the legislative races,” she said.  “The legislature, which is ground zero for policy and budget investment in public safety, is going to play an important role in the coming years in vetting proposed responses to the public sense of lack of safety.”\nElection results in other parts of the country belie claims that the push for criminal justice reform has died. Reform-minded prosecutors and sheriffs in Texas, Colorado, Ohio, Georgia, Illinois, and Florida won their races in the face of similar attacks on reform.\nCalifornia plays an outsized role in the debates about crime and justice reform, but the state is unique in important ways. State laws make it easy to get a recall on the ballot, so reform candidates are more vulnerable to being removed that way.\nAnd the housing crisis and fentanyl boom in California have created an unavoidable sense of disorder and chaos despite steady or decreasing levels of crime. Third, the massive amount of money spent on proxy wars over criminal justice reform in California dwarf similar efforts in other states.\nCalifornia billionaire and former Republican Los Angeles mayoral candidate Rick Caruso spent more than $100 million on his mayoral campaign, which relied heavily on efforts to attack candidate Karen Bass’s ties to Gascón, the LA district attorney, said Irwin.\n“A giant share of that $100 million he spent telling Angelenos that they are not safe, and the reason they are not safe is because of DA Gascón,” she said. “That supercharged the narrative around both safety and DA Gascón in Los Angeles. And even though Rick Caruso failed in his efforts to become LA mayor, he succeeded in his efforts to take down DA Gascón.”\nIn Alameda County, officials are already making preparations to appoint Price’s replacement. The appointee will hold the office until at least 2026, the next time Alameda voters will have the chance to elect their own DA.",

    "text": "local police in upstate New York arrested Dalila Yeend for rolling through a stop sign in 2018 — then handed her over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nThe police in Troy, New York, a city just north of Albany on the eastern banks of the Hudson River, held Yeend overnight for the traffic infraction and called ICE. ICE agents picked her up the next day and detained her at a federal facility in Buffalo. For almost three months, Yeend was separated from her two young children without access to her medication for bipolar disorder.\nThis kind of collaboration between New York’s law enforcement and ICE isn’t new: A handful of Democrats in the state legislature have, for years, been trying to pass legislation that would prevent local police from assisting ICE with immigration enforcement. Lawmakers fear that it prevents noncitizens from interacting with the police when they themselves need help or could assist in reporting crimes or carrying out investigations. Their efforts haven’t gained significant traction so far, but Donald Trump’s impending presidency — and his threats of mass deportation — have created a new urgency.\n“Now more than ever, it is incredibly important that we build whatever walls we can to separate the plans of the Trump administration to conduct mass deportations of immigrants and the power of state and local governments,” said state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, who plans to reintroduce the New York for All Act when the legislative session restarts in January.\nThe sweeping measure would ban New York’s law enforcement from sharing sensitive information and personnel with ICE without a judicial warrant. If that bill had been law in 2018, police would not have been allowed to ask about Yeend’s immigration status and alert the federal government. Yeend’s immigration case was dismissed in 2018, and she got a green card the following year.\nNew York banned state agencies from inquiring about a person’s immigration status in 2017 and from making immigration arrests at courthouses statewide in 2020. But there is still no measure that addresses local law enforcement’s collaboration with ICE more broadly. That means a patchwork of regulations exist across the state. Gounardes noted that the New York for All Act is based on what is largely existing practice in New York City, Westchester County, and among New York’s state police. Gounardes also pointed to Los Angeles City Council passing a sanctuary ordinance last week. “We’re seeing other jurisdictions stepping up at this moment,” he said, “and New York should not be afraid to do the same.”\nOn the other side of the aisle, state Republicans tried to pass a bill last year that would require law enforcement and courts to notify ICE when an arrested person or defendant is not an American citizen. State Sen. Jim Tedisco, a sponsor of the bill, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether he will reintroduce the legislation in the coming year.\nWhile Trump spoke recently about planning to use the military to carry out his deportation plans, ICE leans heavily on state and local authorities. Almost three quarters of ICE arrests in the interior of the U.S. have been handoffs from other law enforcement agencies such as local and state jails or federal prisons, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, or ILRC. “It is state laws and state-powered machinery that drive immigration enforcement,” the group notes. “Whether (Trump) unleashes the National Guard or invokes the Alien Enemies Act or any of the other horrific measures his campaign has touted, the majority of people shunted into the deportation system will continue to be sent there from state and local law enforcement. That is the engine of the system that ICE has built over the last two decades, and on which the Trump administration’s goals rest.”\nA second bill, known as the Dignity Not Detention Act, would prohibit New York’s local jails from maintaining immigration detention contracts that allow the federal government to rent out their jail space. State Sen. Julia Salazar’s office said she plans to reintroduce the bill in January. That would affect at least three facilities in the state, including the Orange County Jail in Goshen, New York. In 2022, immigrants detained at that facility, staged a hunger strike, and subsequently sued ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and members of the Orange County sheriff’s department, among others, in federal court last year. They alleged that they were subject to racist harassment, physical assault, and medical neglect while in custody and were retaliated against for their protests.\n“One of my big fears is that under our current law, the Trump administration can take advantage of local bed space to help achieve their massive deportation and detention strategy,” said Rosa Cohen-Cruz, director of immigration policy at the Bronx Defenders. She is on the steering committee for both bills. Immigration advocates also worry that several New York prisons that have been shut down could be repurposed as potential federal detention facilities.\nTrump will face logistical and legal challenges if he tries to follow through on his anti-immigration threats. “Just because he says mass deportation is going to happen, it does not mean that will be achieved,” said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute. “He’s either unaware or unmindful of the impediments.”\nFinding more capacity won’t be easy. Congress approved a $3.4 billion budget for ICE custody operations for 2024, allowing ICE to detain an average of 41,500 people a night. The mass deportation of millions of people would require much more space — adding pressure onto the federal agencies’ reliance on local and state facilities. (Some states are already keen to help; Texas recently offered Trump a 1,400-acre ranch to build detention centers.)\nLegal precedent could become an issue too, Chishti notes: The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized states’ rights when it comes to gun control — and those rulings also extend to immigration. He acknowledged that having state legislation on the books would make it easier for New York to fight back against a federal anti-immigrant agenda.\nOther Democratic states have prepared more than New York to protect immigrants from federal overreach. The ILRC notes that many blue states, including New York, do not have meaningful safeguards against Trump’s anti-immigrant administration. Only Oregon and Illinois are described as having strong and comprehensive laws protecting immigrants, while California, New Jersey, and Washington are said to have fairly broad sanctuary statues. The ILRC characterizes New York and Rhode Island as having taken “some small steps” toward reducing immigration enforcement. In contrast, it notes five states that have taken aggressive actions that force local agencies to facilitate the detention and deportation of constituents: Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Texas, and West Virginia.\nSome New York counties have been more willing to collaborate with ICE than others. Troy, where Yeend was arrested, is the county seat of Rensselaer County — the only jurisdiction in the state participating in the 287(g) program, which deputizes local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws. ICE noted in an email that there have been 358 encounters with “unlawfully present noncitizens” in Rensselaer County since October 2018, when the program first began. That includes 114 encounters since October 2021, one of which led to a deportation.\nKyle Bourgault, sheriff for Rensselaer County, said he could not respond to a request for comment because of a medical procedure scheduled for Monday. Asked about concerns that Trump may weaponize the program to fulfill his mass deportation goals, ICE recommended reaching out to Trump’s transition team for comment. Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition team, said in an emailed statement that “President Trump will marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation of illegal criminals, drug dealers, and human traffickers in American history while simultaneously lowering costs for families.” She did not address the role of 287(g) programs specifically.\nThere are more than 100 local agencies with 287(g) agreements with ICE across the country. Most are concentrated in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. “The 287(g) program is the most formal kind of cohesion you can have,” said Zach Ahmad, senior policy counsel with the New York Civil Liberties Union. “It sends a message to immigrant communities that they are not welcome.” The New York for All Act would, effectively, ban 287(g) agreements.\nSome immigration advocates worry that a Trump administration will expand the 287(g) program. But they also note that’s not the only way that ICE and local law enforcement join forces. “Often the very same type of collusion occurs even without the agreement,” Ahmad said. “There are all sorts of informal relationships that exist between local law enforcement, ICE, and Border Patrol.”\nNew York state courts established in 2018 that it’s illegal for local law enforcement in New York to hold a person beyond their scheduled release date solely to wait for ICE to pick them up. But there’s nothing stopping police or a sheriff’s office from notifying ICE about an arrest, which makes it easier to transfer custody to federal immigration authorities. New York For All would prohibit that notification process. (New York City already bans this but has carve-outs for about 170 crimes.)\nToday, police can ask whether a person they encounter is undocumented, and share that information with federal immigration authorities at their discretion. Under the federal government’s Secure Communities program, a person who is arrested, even for low-level offenses, could be fingerprinted—and that data is shared with the FBI, which automatically sends fingerprints to DHS to check them against its immigration databases. Sometimes local police call Border Patrol to get translation services, said Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition. “They end up getting handed over to them and in detention,” Awawdeh said. “If we had the New York for All Act, that would not continue.”\nThe lack of a clear statewide law can lead to confusion. In 2022, local police handed Nigerian SUNY Oswego student Richard Ubanwa over to ICE in court. This violated the state’s ban on ICE officers conducting civil arrests in and around courts, as well as a prohibition on local law enforcement holding immigrants after they would normally be released from custody to honor a detainer request from ICE. But it took two years for the New York attorney general to determine that the arrest violated Ubanwa’s rights and require Oswego police to amend their policies.\nEven though New York City has laws in place to limit local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE, immigration advocates argue that the NYPD and Department of Corrections have, at times, broken these rules. They are fighting for a city council measure that would allow people to seek justice in courts when they feel their rights have been violated. In December 2019, the New York Police Department arrested Javier Castillo Maradiaga for jaywalking. The Department of Corrections then transferred Maradiaga to ICE custody despite the city’s ban on this type of coordination. Maradiaga was detained by ICE for 15 months. Then-Mayor Bill de Blasio later acknowledged that the transfer was an “egregious mistake.” But Maradiaga had no avenues for legal recourse — and still doesn’t.\n\nThe New York for All and Dignity Not Detention Acts haven’t even made it to the floor in recent legislative sessions. Democratic leadership has not yet weighed in on whether they will prioritize these bills once the legislative session begins in January. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins did not respond to requests for comment.\n“New York is not a deep-blue state,” said Chishti, with the Migration Policy Institute. “It’s much more difficult to pass a liberal immigration policy in New York today than it was three years ago because the politics of immigration has radically changed.” More than 200,000 migrants have arrived in New York City since 2022. Many state Democrats may veer toward being more moderate to keep their seats, Chishti said: “The most important election is not the one you just finished, but the one ahead of you. They’re looking at their own survival.”\nGounardes is cautiously optimistic that Trump’s victory may inspire action on the bill this year. He blamed the bill’s inability to pass in prior years partly on a tendency to demonize immigrants. Outside the Capitol, Gounardes is an adjunct assistant professor at Hunter College, where some of his students are recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. They are worried about themselves and their families and have asked him what he’s doing to help.\n“These are really heartbreaking conversations that we don’t have all the answers for yet,” he said. “It’s really important that we build as strong a firewall as legally possible, to say that we are doing everything we can to help them.”\nCorrection: November 26, 2024This article incorrectly stated that the New York for All bill would not prevent law enforcement from cooperating with ICE on criminal cases.\n",

    "text": "In 2002, President George W. Bush signed a bill into law that gave the U.S. president the power to invade the Netherlands — or anywhere else on earth — in order to liberate an American citizen or citizen of a U.S. ally being detained for war crimes at the International Criminal Court, based in the Dutch city of The Hague.\nWhile no president has yet made good on this military threat, it serves as shorthand for the U.S. relationship to the international institution of justice. (President Joe Biden, then a senator, opposed the amendment authorizing a Hague invasion before ultimately voting for the bill.) The law was meant to fend off the specter of American troops standing trial for atrocities committed during the fledgling “war on terror,” but the U.S. horror of The Hague has its roots in the longstanding policy of unconditional support for Israel.\nThat same year Bush and his Israeli counterpart, Ariel Sharon, withdrew the U.S. and Israeli signatures from the Rome Statute, the treaty that formed the ICC. U.S.-Israel opposition to any attempt by the court to hold Israel accountable for possible international law violations has been ironclad ever since.\nThe ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant on Thursday, alleging that the leaders intentionally blocked humanitarian aid from entering Gaza in order to target Palestinian civilians and targeted civilians with military strikes on Gaza. They also issued a warrant for Hamas leader Muhammad Deif, while also rescinding warrants for Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, two Hamas leaders killed by Israel. Israel has also claimed to have killed Deif.\nThe warrants, issued by a panel of three judges, require the 124 member nations of the Rome Statute to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant and turn them over to Hague officials for trial the moment that either wanted man steps onto their soil. The ranks of member nations includes many U.S. allies, such as Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada, along with most of the rest of the world.\nAlthough the Biden administration has yet to comment on the arrest warrants, when ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan first applied for warrants in May, the president called the idea “outrageous.”“Whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas,” Biden continued during a White House event to celebrate Jewish Heritage Month. “We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.”\nBiden has kept his word in the months since, continuing to send arms to Israel and vote down all international measures that criticize Israeli conduct — or even call for a ceasefire — in the United Nations. In September, the United States voted against a U.N. resolution that called for the end of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza, with 124 of the 181 U.N. General Assembly nations voting in favor of the measure.\nOn Wednesday, the Biden administration vetoed yet another ceasefire resolution in the U.N. Security Council — the fourth such resolution it has voted down. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Woods claimed that the resolution did not include calls for an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, despite the fact that the document called for an unconditional release of the hostages. Among the 15 nations on the council, the U.S. was the lone dissenting vote.\n“I think we’re heading for a significant showdown on international law between the United States and the rest of the world,” said Michael Lynk, an international law expert who served as the U.N.’s special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories. “I think this is going to open up an even wider breach between the U.S. on the one hand, in international law, and most of the rest of the world on the other.”\nThe ICC arrest warrants place U.S. and Israel allies in an awkward position: maintain U.S. partnership or respect its obligations to The Hague and international law. So far, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government would “stand up for international law” and “abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts.” France and the U.K. have expressed similar support, but Germany, which also provides military aid to Israel, has yet to issue any official statement on how it plans to respond.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who also faces an ICC arrest warrant, has had to alter his travel plans to avoid arrest. In September, however, he was able to travel to and from Mongolia, a Rome Statute signatory, without incident.\nIn addition to the ICC warrants, next September is the expiration of the U.N. deadline for Israel to cease its occupation of West Bank and East Jerusalem. Also, the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, is continuing to oversee the genocide trial South Africa has brought against Israel, but that process will likely take several more years.\n“This alliance the United States has with Israel has really stained the image of the United States to the rest of the world,” said Lynk. He celebrated the ICC’s warrant announcement and said the measure is a rare form of accountability missing from the international community amid Israel’s war on Gaza and its occupation of Palestinian territories since 1967.\n“There has been virtually no red line drawn for Israel that it hasn’t crossed and that it understands in crossing all these lines, the international community doesn’t have the political will to demand accountability and the end of impunity,” he said.\nBut Lynk noted that such lack of accountability to Israel is longstanding. He said that among the reasons the U.S. opposed the Rome Statute and formation of The Hague’s criminal court had been concerned that the court’s statutes criminalize Israel’s settlements on Palestinian land in the West Bank. Israel also cited the statute, which outlaws the forcible movement of civilian populations by an occupying military power, as among its reasons for opposing the treaty.\nSince then, the U.S. has opposed other investigations into alleged Israeli atrocities, as well as the court’s attempts to hold American military members accountable for alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. The Trump administration also sanctioned the ICC officials involved in past investigations into Israeli conduct, freezing their assets and banning their travel to the U.S. Biden overturned the measure but has continued to voice his support of Israel in the face of further ICC pressure. In June, a Republican-led House bill, supported by 42 Democrats, called for a new round of sanctions on the ICC.\nWhile condemning the court’s due process when applied to Israel, the U.S. has cheered on some of the court’s other actions, including the ICC’s issuing of arrest warrants for Russian officials, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, over atrocities committed in its war in Ukraine.\n“We either hate this institution, or we’ll cooperate on cases we like,” said Jennifer Trahan, an international law and human rights professor at New York University. “Initially Biden called these warrants ‘outrageous’ — but it’s the same institution that has issued warrants against Russian nationals and received praise for doing so. Ultimately you don’t want to have politics involved in a judicial institution — it should be allowed to do its work.”She also referenced the U.S. support for other ICC investigations, such as the 2012 case against Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony, founder of the Lord’s Resistance Army. Biden’s State Department in 2021 put out a $5 million reward for information that leads to finding Kony, who remains a fugitive. The Obama administration also threw its support behind the ICC case against al-Bashir, the first sitting head of state to be indicted by the court.\n“Keep in mind, this is the first time that arrest warrants from the International Criminal Court have been issued against any ally of the West — they’ve almost exclusively been in Africa,” Lynk said.\nWhile human rights groups also praised the ICC warrants, some wondered whether Biden himself would be held accountable for complicity in Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza. The Biden administration has given more than $20 billion in military aid to Israel, fueling its military aggression in Gaza, where more than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed, more than half of which are women and children, and more than 3,500 in Lebanon. And last week, the State Department said it would continue to arm Israel, even after the country failed to meet most of the administration’s demands to improve the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\nThere is legal precedent for similar cases against arms suppliers, such as the case of Frans van Anraat, a Dutch businessman who was convicted by The Hague in 2005 for complicity in war crimes due to his role in selling materials to Saddam Hussein’s government, which were used to create chemical weapons.\nLynk said that both the ICJ and ICC have legal standing to pursue a case against U.S. officials for aiding Israel’s atrocities, but due to limited judicial resources, such charges would be unlikely.\nUpdate: November 22, 2024This story has been updated with more information on President Biden’s support for the 2002 law that gave the U.S. president the power to use military force to retrieve U.S. citizens or allied citizens detained by the International Criminal Court. Biden did vote for the law as part of a larger appropriations bill, but had earlier opposed the amendment that added those specific powers to the bill.",

    "text": "In December, Bridget Rochios, a nurse practitioner and midwife at the University of California, San Francisco, showed up to work wearing a keffiyeh.\nLater, she and other co-workers started coming to work wearing “Free Palestine” pins, as well as hospital ID badges shaped like a watermelon, a pro-Palestine symbol.\nRochios, whose work includes addressing health disparities within reproductive health care, had been moved by reports of Israel’s targeting and destruction of Gaza’s hospitals and health care system, and started wearing the items as a show of solidarity with Palestinian women and babies, as well as her medical colleagues in Gaza.\nSupervisors ordered Rochios and her colleagues to remove the pins, threatening them with suspension or termination. Most complied, but Rochios refused.\nIn April, she traveled to Gaza where she spent a month delivering babies at a maternity hospital in Rafah and the al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah. She saw some of the many delivering mothers who have suffered under dire conditions in Gaza.\nA week after she returned to the U.S., her supervisors at the UCSF Mission Bay campus, one of the graduate school and hospital system’s 10 campuses, placed Rochios on a three-month paid administrative leave for “insubordination.” Her suspension was renewed in September after she again refused to remove her watermelon pin. She may still face further sanctions, including termination. University representatives have told her that several colleagues and patients said the pin made them feel “unsafe.”\n“The people who are really ‘unsafe’ are the women who I was supporting in labor as literally bombs were dropping and shaking the walls of our hospital,” Rochios told The Intercept, recalling moments during Israel’s invasion of Rafah. “Women who have not had prenatal care at all; women who went to walk to the hospital in labor and have a baby, and then two hours later, walk back home to their tent where they did not have running water, where they don’t have enough food or hydration to breastfeed, no clean water, or money to buy formula for their kids.”\nMedical professionals, especially those who have treated patients in Gaza’s and Lebanon’s hospitals over the past year, have spoken out about atrocities carried out by the Israeli military. Doing so at UCSF, one of the country’s most elite medical institutions, may come at a price.\nRochios is one of nine health care workers at UCSF who spoke with The Intercept about their experiences of censorship and punishment after speaking out about human rights for Palestinians as a part of their research and medical work.\nUCSF declined to comment or respond to a detailed list of questions or multiple phone calls over the course of a week. A UCSF spokesperson said they were concerned that the accounts of UCSF employees were being “taken out of context.”\nRupa Marya, an internal medicine physician and professor at UCSF, is perhaps the most notable and vocal among those who have received pushback. In her social media posts in January, Marya, an expert in decolonial theory, questioned the impacts of Zionism as “a supremacist, racist ideology” on health care and drew immediate criticism from pro-Israel colleagues and Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener.\nThe university then published a statement across its social media accounts addressing the posts without naming Marya, disavowing her statements as “antisemitic attacks.” Wiener thanked UCSF for the statement. A flurry of online attacks against Marya followed, including racist and sexist attacks and threats of death and sexual violence. Wiener has continued to single out Marya on social media.\nIn September, Marya wrote a new post on social media that UCSF students were concerned that a first-year student from Israel may have served in the Israeli military in the prior year, then asked, “How do we address this in our professional ranks?”\nThe following month, the university placed her on paid leave and suspended her ability to practice medicine pending an investigation into the post. The university has since reinstated her ability to give clinical care, but she remains banned from campus, including the hospital where she worked.\n“I wanted to protect people who have lost family members,” Marya said. “People are being murdered, doctors are being disappeared, hospitals are being bombed — you have this traumatized community in UCSF. I’ve been trying to give voice to the experience of the Muslim, Indigenous, Black, SWANA” — Southwest Asian and North African — “students who are afraid, like deeply afraid.”\nThe Center for Protest Law and Litigation, a First Amendment group, is assisting Marya in obtaining public records of possible communications about her social media posts between UCSF, Wiener, and the Helen Diller Family Foundation, the school’s largest donor that has in the past donated to pro-Israel propaganda groups. The center filed suit for the records after the university failed to produce documents after nine months of back and forth, during which the school claimed such records are exempt from freedom of information laws.\nIn a statement sent to The Intercept, Wiener said Marya’s social media posts “crossed a line,” accusing her of using “an antisemitic conspiracy theory targeting Jewish doctors” and an Israeli medical student. He said concerned UCSF faculty and students brought the January and October posts to his attention. “I then called out those posts as antisemitic, just as I have called out homophobic, transphobic, racist, and Islamophobic statements by various individuals,” he wrote.\nWiener, as a part of the legislature’s Jewish Caucus, previously targeted K-12 school districts for teaching history lessons that were critical of Israel, dismissing them as “bigoted, inaccurate, discriminatory, and deeply offensive anti-Jewish and anti-Israel propaganda,” according to a January letter to state lawmakers. He decried the online threats against Marya, calling for an investigation.\nThe school’s crackdown has been broad, targeting professors, doctors, and medical staff.\nDoctors have had their lectures mentioning Gaza scrubbed from the internet or canceled outright. They have been accused of antisemitism and creating an unsafe work environment, and banned from lecturing entirely. Staffers, nurses, and students have been suspended for speaking out in solidarity or for acts as simple as wearing a watermelon pin or hanging a pro-Palestine symbol in their offices. Dozens of employees have criticized the ongoing silence from UCSF and its failure to condemn Israel’s war on Gaza, accusing the school of favoring pro-Israel views.\n“This is really unprecedented where this university in particular has stepped in and taken such a strong stand in support of some speech and opposition to other speech,” said Dan Siegel, a longtime Bay Area civil rights attorney who is representing several UCSF employees facing discipline. “It’s really remarkable to me that there is so much content-based discrimination here.”\nFor the past 30 years, Siegel has represented faculty and staff across the UC system in employment and workplace issues. Before October 7, he had never seen such a widespread effort to punish employees for speaking out about a specific issue.\n“Among the supporters of the Israeli government, this is a cynical and manipulative effort to limit debate,” he said. “They’ve promoted an atmosphere where you’re a student at the university or a patient at the hospital, and it becomes perfectly normalized for you to say or for someone to champion your saying, ‘I feel uncomfortable as a Jew because of people saying these things,” said Siegel, who is Jewish.\n“Look, I don’t want to make people feel uncomfortable, but aren’t people made uncomfortable by 40,000 dead in Gaza or the efforts taking place in the West Bank to steal Palestinian land?” Siegel asked. “Those things make me feel uncomfortable — so now we’re all going to be censoring each other’s speech because it makes us uncomfortable, and that really can’t be the criteria for limiting speech.”\nIn late July, a group of House Republicans, including House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., told UCSF they would investigate allegations of antisemitism made by employees and patients at the institution. The members of Congress threatened to withhold all federal funding, including Medicare and Medicaid payments, from the school and health care system. Their investigation is a part of a larger partisan effort, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., targeting universities whose students and faculty have been vocal critics of Israel.\nThree UCSF physicians have been banned from giving lectures after mentioning the negative health impacts of Israel’s war on Gaza or the apartheid health system in the Occupied Territories.\nJess Ghannam had received pushback for his scholarship in the past. In 2012, an attendee of one of his lectures about Gaza at UCSF called the police on him, saying they didn’t feel safe with him on campus, Ghannam recalled. Later that year, a student burst into tears and ran out of a lecture Ghannam was delivering at UC Davis and later filed a complaint alleging that Ghannam had created an unsafe learning environment. (UC Davis launched a formal investigation, which eventually saw the complaint dismissed.)\nIn his 25 years at the university, Ghannam never had any of his lectures canceled outright. He is a well-known speaker who has shared his research on the consequences of war on displaced communities, such as Palestinians, in many venues over the past two decades. And he helped establish mental health and medical clinics for Palestinians, interviewing Palestinian torture survivors who were incarcerated in Israeli prisons.\nIn September, he was scheduled to speak to first-year medical students, after a group of medical students had met with the university’s deans to push for more education around Palestine.\nThen, four days before the scheduled talk, Ghannam heard from the course instructor that his lecture was being canceled. The instructor said there wasn’t enough time to provide “wraparound services” for students, or peer support or support services, for those who may be distressed by the topic, Ghannam said.\nStudents responded with outrage. Ninety-five medical students signed a letter addressed to school officials, calling the cancellation “an act of intentional erasure of historical harms that continue to affect our communities and our profession” and alleging that it was part of “a pattern of suppression that seemingly targets any element of acknowledgement or advocacy for the health of Palestinians, despite UCSF’s claimed position as a bastion of social justice.” The students went on to host Ghannam independently, allowing him to give his lecture in front of about 100 people.\n“If you talk about Palestine,” Ghannam said of his critics’ perspective, “if you talk about the health consequences of genocide, and the negative impact of genocide and settler colonialism, it’s OK to talk about it in any other people except Palestinians — and then if you do try to talk about it in the Palestinian context, we’re going to shut you down.”\n“I mean, that’s the clear message: You can’t talk about Palestine, you can’t talk about genocide.”\nLeigh Kimberg had a similar experience. Kimberg, a medical school professor, primary care doctor, and leader in the field of violence prevention and trauma-informed care, had lectured at UCSF’s continuing education program several times in the past decade.\nIn April, she gave a 50-minute lecture and dedicated six of those minutes to a discussion of the health of Palestinians in Gaza. She argued that you cannot speak on trauma-informed care without mentioning the genocide in Gaza and described the connections between the liberation of Black, Palestinian, and Jewish people. She also decried antisemitism during her lecture.\nStill, the following month, administrators told Kimberg that they had received complaints from attendees who called her speech “biased and antisemitic,” which prompted the school to remove the recording of her talk from the school’s website. When she protested the video’s removal, she said the school barred her from giving lectures at the program.\nThe ban was lifted after multiple emails from Kimberg and Siegel, who is representing her, but she was told that her future talks must comply with the program’s rules. She also received pushback from her division at the school of medicine, where colleagues have referred to her as “inflammatory” or “not trauma-informed.”\nKimberg began to speak out about Palestine publicly last October, and her Palestinian colleagues welcomed her perspective as a person of Jewish ancestry. Her grandparents had fled antisemitic violence in Poland and Lithuania, and three of her relatives died in the Holocaust. But her colleagues also cautioned her of the backlash to come.\n“We do want to warn you that the second you advocate for Palestine, you will be called ‘antisemitic,’” Kimberg recalled from earlier conversations with Palestinian colleagues. “It doesn’t matter that you’re Jewish — in some ways, it will be worse — but you will definitely be called ‘antisemitic’ if you say anything to value Palestinian life.”\n“And that has been my experience.”\nSuch discrimination is what led Keith Hansen, a former chief resident of surgery at UCSF, to conceal his Palestinian heritage throughout his career. As chief resident in the fall of 2023, Hansen would send daily emails to his co-workers at the trauma surgery department at San Francisco General Hospital, highlighting updates across their field. In one of those emails in October, as reports of Israeli strikes on hospitals in Gaza began to compile, he skipped the updates and instead asked his colleagues “to take a moment to acknowledge that doctors and surgeons and patients, just like us, were being bombed by the Israeli government.”\nHansen received positive feedback for the email from his co-workers, but in his monthly review to assess his performance as a resident, an attending physician referred to Hansen as “a polarizing figure” because of the email.\nIn May, as student activists continued to occupy a protest encampment at the school’s Parnassus Heights campus, Hansen gave a lecture as chief resident about his work in organ transplantation along with health inequities of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank under Israeli occupation.\nDuring the talk, he also disclosed his Palestinian heritage, something he had never done in his career. He shared that he was born in Jordan to Palestinian refugees, his mother from Ramallah and his father from Jenin. After running through data showing health disparities between Palestinians living under occupation and Israeli citizens, as well as the targeting of physicians in Gaza, he called on the university to do more to address such issues. He referenced other UCSF initiatives, such as fundraising to protect doctors and scholars in Afghanistan and Ukraine. He went on to call for an academic boycott of institutions “complicit in the genocide and medical apartheid.”\nFollowing his talk, several colleagues lodged complaints against him that he was creating an unsafe working environment. The chair of his department also directed him and other speakers not to mention “anything political or anything that didn’t have to do with graduation.” At graduation, he said people he had previously gotten along with avoided him.\n“There’s that term — ‘liberal except for Palestine’ or ‘humanitarian except for Palestine’ — and a lot of people as soon as they hear you’re Palestinian just change their entire view of you,” Hansen said. “And it has changed my relationship — I mean, there were people at graduation who didn’t talk to me, who I had known for years and always got along with really well. Everyone kind of shows their true colors once they find out your background.”\nAt the same time, pro-Israel speakers have been invited to campus while Palestinian voices have been opposed. Among those speakers were Elan Carr, a U.S. Army veteran and CEO of the Israeli American Council, an influential pro-Israel lobbying and advocacy group. UCSF’s Office of Diversity and Outreach invited him to speak during May’s Jewish American Heritage Month.\nNearly 100 faculty, medical workers, and students wrote to the diversity office, protesting Carr’s talk, citing his role at a counterprotest against student encampments at UCLA that turned violent a month earlier, as well as his endorsement of transphobic comments on social media. Carr’s speech on “the persistence of anti-Zionism, anti-Israel discrimination, and campus antisemitism” went on as planned.\nThe same office declined to sponsor and publicize an official screening of documentary “Israelism,” which was hosted by the school’s chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace. The film centers on the advocacy of anti-Zionist Jewish activists.\nSome staffers have been disciplined for a speech act as quiet as wearing a pin.\nShortly after October 7, Rosita, a nurse at UCSF who gave only her first name out of fear of being doxxed by pro-Israel activists, started hand-making watermelon pins for her co-workers to attach to their hospital ID cards, green glittery resin disks with a small rubber watermelon glued on top.\nA slice of the fruit has been a symbol of Palestinian liberation since the 1980s, when Palestinian artists started to use the depictions of the watermelon, with its red flesh, green rind, and black seeds, as a way to circumvent an Israeli ban on public displays of the Palestinian flag in Gaza and the West Bank. Rosita passed her pins out to interested colleagues at work and to others during pro-Palestine protests.\nIn a relatively uniform work environment such as a hospital floor or clinic, custom badge pins are typical ways for medical workers to express themselves. At UCSF, such displays are often political, with many wearing pins that advocate for LGBTQ rights or the Black Lives Matter movement. In the past, UCSF even gave away its own uterus pins meant to affirm reproductive rights, said Rosita, who also helped found the school’s faculty and staff pro-Palestinian group.\n“I can tell what type of person you are by the pins that you have on your badge,” she said. “So it’s a sense of pride and solidarity and acknowledgment.”\nIn all, Rosita said she has made and given away 500 pins. And while many workers received compliments from colleagues and patients, those who wore the pins started to get approached by their managers, telling them the pins were antisemitic and ordering them to remove them under threat of suspension or termination.\nIn September, Rosita’s manager called her in for a “counseling” session where she was told to remove the pin because a staff member said it made them feel “uncomfortable.” She refused and responded with an email, calling the manager’s request “discrimination and denial of the Palestinian people.”\n“My niece is Palestinian,” she wrote in the email. “She is 10 years old. She enjoys collecting Polly Pockets and does jujitsu on Saturdays, studies Arabic on Sundays.”\n“She exists!” Rosita added. “I wear the watermelon because she exists!”\nRosita, who is Rochios’s union steward and has been representing her in disciplinary hearings, said she worried she would be met with similar punishment.\nAnother staff member faced similar pushback for displaying pro-Palestine symbols. A researcher at UCSF, who declined to give their name due to fear of workplace retaliation, was told by supervisors to remove a sign from their office that said “Queer as in Free Palestine” with a red and pink triangle. The staff member, who is queer, said the sign was meant to express solidarity between the LGBTQ community and Palestinians. They noted that their Mexican LGBTQ flag had been accepted. Leading up to the ban, the researcher had received an online death threat for displaying the symbol, and one community member confronted them inside their office, accusing them of supporting Hamas.\nThe school told them the red triangle was a Nazi symbol that is being used to promote violence against Jewish people. The ban remains on the staff member’s employee file. Since reporting the death threat, the school has yet to offer a safety plan for the staff member, who as a result has been working remotely since September.“It’s been really tough. I’ve had to take time off, my mental and physical health is just shot at this point from the stress and anxiety, not knowing whether I’m going to lose my job,” they said.\nAnother staffer received a notice of intent to fire her just for discussing accusations lodged against them with colleagues. In January, UCSF therapist Denise Caramagno quote tweeted, to her modest following of 500 users on X, the school’s public rebuke of Marya with the following: “@UCSF is coordinating an attack on its own faculty of color who are asking legitimate questions about social determinants of health. This is a violation of academic speech. How are we to achieve health equity if we cannot ask important questions about systems of supremacy?”\nSeveral months later in May, Caramagno’s supervisor sent an email, flagging that a physician at UCSF sent a complaint about Caramagno’s post to school officials and a complaint officer in the diversity office, calling the tweet antisemitic and questioning Caramagno’s ability to “offer psychological support to Jewish and Israeli faculty and staff.”\nOver the past decade, Caramagno helped build the school’s CARE program, which provides resources and support to those on campus who have experienced discrimination, harassment, or abuse. As the co-director, she had remained the point of contact for students to reach out to confidentially and become a trusted source of support to students during difficult moments, including amid protests during the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements. She’s regularly called out systemic racism as a part of her role.\n“When I see what’s happening in Palestine, it just looks like the most extreme form of racism,” Caramagno said, referring to the genocide in Gaza. “We’re a public health care system, so when we see the dismantling of the public health care system [in Gaza], we have an obligation to call that out.”\nWhile the complaint did not lead to any discipline, she was barred from serving as a point of contact for individuals with reports of antisemitism.\nIn June, her supervisors caught wind that Caramagno had shared the email from her supervisor that included the complaint with close friends and colleagues, seeking guidance and support on how to proceed. Supervisors told her that she was not allowed to share the email, which they considered confidential. Caramagno and her attorney, Siegel, insist the email was not confidential, which she dismissed as “defamatory.” Even so, by August she was suspended and then received notice of the school’s intent to fire her. She is barred from campus and from contacting her clients.\n“I’m a trained clinician in this; I know the laws about confidentiality,” Caramagno said. “I know I had never breached confidentiality, and I never will.”\nLast week, a group of faculty staff and students, including Kimberg and Ghannam, gathered for the first session of the UC People’s Tribunal, a group that aims to hold UC leaders accountable for the school system’s complicity with Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza and the ongoing displacement of Palestinians.\nIn addition to the violent crackdown on student encampments across the UC system last spring, school leaders have long shown a pro-Israel bias in their longstanding opposition to attempts by student and faculty groups to join academic boycotts of institutions with ties to Israel. The tactic is part of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, or BDS, which aims to achieve Palestinian statehood.\nThe People’s group, which presented the tribunal charges at La Peña Cultural Center in Berkeley, focused on the UC’s investments in Israeli companies and the other activities of UCSF’s largest private donor, the Diller family. A collection of foundations created by the Bay Area real estate billionaire Sanford Diller, who died in 2018, gave a massive $1 billion to the school in 2017 and 2018, after giving $150 million over the previous 15 years.\nThe foundations, named for Diller’s late wife Helen, also donated $100,000 in 2016 to the Canary Mission, a group that aims to blacklist students and professors at universities who are found to be critical of Israel. Once an individual is listed on the Canary Mission site, a flood of cyberbullying messages often follow in an attempt to ruin the person’s reputation. The site has a profile for Ghannam and Marya, accusing both of supporting terrorism and antisemitism. Ghannam jokingly called himself one of the site’s “inaugural” members, or a “first-gen Canary Mission.” The group also recently celebrated Marya’s suspension on social media.\nIn 2016, the Diller Foundation also donated $25,000 to Regavim, an Israeli NGO that sues Palestinians who try to build homes in the occupied West Bank; $100,000 to Reservists on Duty, a group that pays for Israeli reserve soldiers to travel to U.S. universities to work with students on projects that challenge BDS; and $25,000 to Turning Point USA “for US campus efforts against BDS.” And the foundation has donated to Islamophobic groups American Freedom Law Center and Stop Islamization of America, along with American right-wing conservative groups, Project Veritas and the David Horowitz Freedom Center.\nJackie Safier, Sanford Diller’s daughter, who now runs the Diller Foundation, has dismissed connections between the foundation and the far-right Zionist and conservative groups in the U.S. and Israel. Given the foundation’s close ties with UCSF, however, faculty and staff who have faced punishment for their pro-Palestine speech have questioned whether the relationship was a factor.\n“You can’t walk anywhere at UCSF without seeing Helen Diller’s name somewhere,” Ghannam said. “The foundation’s name is in the front of UCSF, the main entrance, they’ve endowed chairs and faculty positions.”\nGhannam had hoped to travel to Gaza to assist patients there during this past year, but has been barred due to Israeli travel restrictions into the territory for individuals with Palestinian ancestry. He instead has been forced to watch the conflict from afar, doing what he can with organizing at UCSF, while Israeli strikes kill people he’s close with.\n“There’s this awesomeness of feeling the solidarity; people are finally understanding Palestine in ways that they never understood before,” Ghannam said. “But at the same time, the amount of fucking grief and pain that I feel every day with knowing that my colleagues have been killed, that all clinics that we helped build and all the programs we help build and all of the people whose kids I’ve seen grown up over the years and get married — they’re all dead, so there’s this profound sense of grief and guilt.”\nRochios’s advocacy on the health inequality experienced by Palestinians in Gaza began by speaking out at home, both at the workplace and at rallies in the Bay Area. When Rochios, who was allowed to travel to Gaza, was working in Rafah in April, she began to share what she was witnessing on television news for outlets such as Al Jazeera.\n“While the West seems to not give any weight or validation to Palestinian reporters on the ground, these health care workers have become the journalists, the storytellers, all this information, and it became very clear to me to that it was my duty to try and be a voice to that,” she said.\nUCSF escalated its punishment against Rochios this week, moving her from a paid suspension to three days unpaid. She will be allowed to return to work for the first time since June on November 21, but was again ordered not to wear her keffiyeh or watermelon badge. If she continues to wear the items, the school said, she would be in violation of UCSF’s PRIDE policies and Principles of Community, which are among several codes meant to reinforce diversity and inclusion within the institution. She expects to be fired, given the climate of repression she and her colleagues have experienced at UCSF.\nThrough conversations with colleagues in the OBGYN department at the nearby city-run San Francisco General Hospital, Rochios knows that this outcome is not the norm in her profession, even within the same city. Unlike at UCSF, the hospital workers have been able to display their support for Palestine, with some openly wearing sweatshirts that read “Healthcare workers for Palestine.”\n“I’ve become such a pariah in this way within UCSF,” she said. “Whereas it exists without issue in a sister hospital in the same city.”\nCorrection: November 19, 2024, 11:23 a.m. ETThis article originally referred to Rupa Marya as a lecturer at UCSF. She is a professor of medicine.",

    "text": "LAST WEEK, police at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland arrested four students on felony vandalism charges in relation to protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. The students were transferred to the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, jail, a detention facility subject to calls for closure over inhumane conditions, abuse by jail staff, and the use of solitary confinement. All four students were released from jail over the weekend.\nThe arrests are part of the long arm of the crackdowns on campus protests that started in the spring and kept pace this fall. School officials had described the spray paint as “antisemitic.”\nA local news clip shows a wall spray-painted with the names of Palestine, Sudan, Congo, and Haiti. A building entrance was also splashed with red paint, including handprints, with posted signs that say, “Your school funds genocide.”\nThe protest and its aftermath came as Case Western was facing a federal civil rights complaint alleging bias against protesters and Palestinian students. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Education opened a Title VI investigation at Case Western.\nThe latest arrests were part of an expansive crackdown: The school spent more than $250,000 on public safety staffing, equipment, and remediation after tearing down protest encampments, including removing signs and painting over murals on a campus “spirit wall,” according to documents reviewed by The Intercept.  (The school said it could not comment on the criminal investigation.)\nCase Western issued notices of interim suspension or other warnings to students after protests in the spring and barred some graduating students from campus. Only one student, however, was suspended for the fall semester: Yousef Khalaf, president of the school’s undergraduate chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine.\nAmong seven violations referenced in the notices, Khalaf faces school disciplinary allegations for engaging in intimidating behavior, including using the chant “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.” He is barred from campus until the spring of 2025.\nKhalaf said he was treated differently than other protesters. His was the only case for which the school hired an outside firm, BakerHostetler, he said. He said SJP students have been contacted by school administrators for posting flyers or attending group events. (BakerHostetler and Case Western did not respond to a request for comment.)\n“They don’t treat any other club this way,” Khalaf said. “We see very clearly the ‘Palestine exception’ being applied here.”\nWith Israel’s war on Gaza entering its second year, Khalaf is among thousands of students and faculty members still being targeted in universities’ battles over harsh protest crackdowns, free speech, academic independence, and discrimination.\nThe fights are playing out online, in campus quads, internal disciplinary proceedings, and in the courts. Organizers among the students and faculty say universities are retaliating against them for their activism and restricting their civil liberties and freedom of expression while claiming to uphold both.\nAs campus protests reached their height in May, Dahlia Saba, a second-year Palestinian American graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, wrote an op-ed supporting the demonstrators’ demands. She called on the school to address calls to divest from industries that profit from Israel’s war. She and her co-author Vignesh Ramachandran, another graduate student, were met with student nonacademic disciplinary investigations that relied solely on the op-ed for evidence.\n“The university is threatening us with sanctions that could jeopardize our academic careers if we choose to speak out again,” Saba said. “They’re low-level sanctions to begin with, but the university is pursuing sanctions against many people on very little evidence.”\nThe issue is not so much the severity of the sanctions, Saba said, but using punishments to chill students’ speech. The disciplinary actions become a tool, she said, to help universities keep track of people involved in protests for Palestine.\n“They are basically trying to get any sort of sanction on people’s records,” Saba said, “so that if they speak up again, if they do anything that criticizes the university’s investment policy, or if they in any way speak out in support of Palestine or in solidarity with Palestine, that students could be scared that the university could bring further charges against them that could then enact harsher consequences.”\nLast month, 13 police officers stormed the home of student organizers at the University of Pennsylvania to conduct a raid on suspicion of a month-old incident of vandalism in connection to Gaza protests. Pomona College unilaterally suspended 10 students for the remainder of the academic year for allegedly participating in protests for divestment.\nSchools across the country spent this summer preparing to preempt pro-Palestinian activism come fall. At a campus safety conference, more than 450 people working on the issue discussed, among other topics, “preparing for, responding to, and recovering from on-campus protests.”\nThat preparation was evident as schools readied themselves last month for protests planned around the October 7 anniversary. Ahead of planned walkouts and protests across New York City, administrators at Columbia University warned the community to prepare for potential violence. The night before the walkout, Columbia University Law School told professors to call campus police on protesters.\nMeanwhile, students and advocacy groups are pushing back on university administrators for their responses to protests and battling new policies governing protests and freedom of expression that they say show an anti-Palestinian bias.\nThe crackdown on student protests has led to a raft of court cases and federal complaints. Students at the University of California, Irvine sued the school chancellor and regents in July, saying the school had suspended protesters without due process. The school is arguing that an upcoming December court date is unnecessary because the suspensions have ended, said attorney Thomas Harvey, who is representing students.\n“The university and the state are using whatever tools they have to stop people from protesting war crimes and genocide paid for by tax dollars and invested in by their university,” Harvey said. “Their argument is effectively about the required decorum while protesting mass death and human suffering.”\nLast month, prosecutors charged at least 49 people, including Irvine students and faculty, with misdemeanors for failing to vacate encampments this spring. Arraignments will continue through mid-December, and cases that go to trial won’t do so until January or February.\nThe San Diego City Attorney’s Office dismissed all charges against student protesters at University of California, San Diego earlier this month. Prosecutors in Irvine, however, have shown no indication that they’ll dismiss their charges, even amid pleas from Irvine Mayor Farrah N. Khan.\nHarvey, the students’ attorney, said the school is fearful of losing donors.\n“It’s to their benefit financially to publicly show that they are, in quotes, cracking down,” he said. Students and faculty are facing criminal charges and disciplinary conduct hearings from the school, including suspensions and probation, he said. “It’s just a climate of real crackdown on pro-Palestinian voices.”\nSimilar complaints alleging discrimination against protesters and Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim students were filed against Case Western and Rutgers University in New Jersey, which is under a federal civil rights investigation. (I co-teach a class at Rutgers’s New Brunswick campus.)\nIn September, the University of Maryland moved to cancel a protest organized by SJP and Jewish Voice for Peace after receiving complaints about the event. The group Palestine Legal and the Council on American-Islamic Relations then filed suit over the protest cancellation. (The school declined to comment and pointed to a statement from the university president.)\nLast month, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to allow the demonstration to go ahead. The suit, which claims that the university violated students’ First Amendment rights by canceling the protest, is still pending in court.\nShatha Shahin, a third-year law student at Case Western and the president of the law school’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, said the university tried to make an example of Khalaf, the undergraduate SJP president.\n“There is definitely a hostility in the way they’ve treated and used Yousef as this mastermind for everything that went on behind the scenes for all the Palestine advocacy,” Shahin said.\nIn August, Case Western began enforcing new rules governing speech and protest activity. Administrators prohibited encampments and the use of projected images, microphones, or bullhorns. Protests larger than 20 people now require approval from a committee.\n“It’s very deliberate, and it’s very calculated,” said Maryam Assar, an Ohio attorney working with student protesters who is herself an alumnus of the School of Law at Case Western. “That’s why it’s really problematic that they’re going through all of these steps to silence them.”\nAssar said the contrast between the treatment of pro-Palestinian organizers and other groups was stark.\n“They speak with Hillel, they talk to Hillel,” she said, referring to the avowedly pro-Israel campus Jewish organization, “but they won’t even talk to these kids.”\nWhile some student protesters face retaliation from administrators, others say they’ve also faced discrimination on campus. A New Jersey man was charged in April with vandalizing the Center for Islamic Life at Rutgers University–New Brunswick on Eid al-Fitr. That same month, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the New Jersey chapter of CAIR filed a federal Title VI complaint against Rutgers alleging that the school had demonstrated a pattern of bias against Muslim and Arab students.\nIn a statement to The Intercept, Megan Schumann, the head of public relations at Rutgers, said the school was fully cooperating with the civil rights investigation and that the university takes seriously every claim of bias.\nAt the school’s protest encampment in May, a counterprotester was filmed hitting a pro-Palestine student. Schumann said Rutgers University Police Department charged the man with bias intimidation, harassment, and simple assault and that the case was pending in court.\nThe school negotiated with students to disband campus encampments later that month. In December 2023, Rutgers–New Brunswick had suspended its chapter of SJP for a year. The club was reinstated in January, but in August, the school slapped SJP with another suspension that is expected to last until July 2025.\nRutgers students have also filed dozens of complaints of bias toward Arab and Muslim students from professors and other faculty. In November, student protesters disrupted a Rutgers event with Bruce Hoffman, a self-described Zionist who works as a counterterrorism expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. A group of four Muslim students wearing hijabs who were not part of the disruption said that, after they left the event, a professor approached them. According to the student and her friends, who confirmed the story, the professor filmed them, telling them to “smile” for the camera, and accused them of ruining the event.\n“She was pointing her finger in my face,” said the student, who, like her friends, asked for anonymity for fear of retaliation by the school. At least two of the students filed bias reports against the professor; a copy of one was provided to The Intercept. “The professor clearly targeted students who were evidently Muslim and violated our personal space while instigating this incident outside of the classroom which we had already left from,” she wrote. (Schumann, the Rutgers spokesperson, declined to comment on questions about specific allegations against faculty or staff.)\n“This is a falsified account of the events that occurred and printing these comments about me would not only be considered defamation, but also likely rise to the level of slander,” the professor said in a statement to The Intercept. They declined to comment further.\nThe professor also filed a bias complaint against the students. While none of the students were found guilty of conduct violations as a result of the complaint, one was told that they were no longer eligible for a resident assistant position because of an outstanding complaint against them.\nUniversities have demonstrated a willingness to cave to the demands of donors to try to control free speech among students. At Case Western, Assar, the Ohio attorney, suggested such pressure was brought to bear.\n“They’re really freaked out because donors are upset that this is happening,” Assar said of school administrators, “and they imagine that they can control these kids.”\nWhen pro-Palestine students at the University of Maryland began planning their October 7 anniversary protest, the school president and other administrators initially said they would protect the group’s right to hold the protest, said Abel Amene, a fourth-year student and a board member of the school’s SJP chapter who helped organize the protest. (He is also a member of the University of Maryland student government and an elected volunteer member of D.C’s Advisory Neighborhood Commission, but did not speak in either capacity.)\n“Then they began indicating that they were getting pressure through emails, through various Zionist organizations on campus and off campus, pressuring them to cancel our event,” he said.\nShortly after expressing their support for free speech, administrators proceeded to cancel the event. They said there had been “overwhelming outreach” about the protest, even while acknowledging that it posed no threat.\nAfter the federal court order forced the school to allow the protest to proceed, Abel said, the school still took actions that restricted the demonstration. The grounds were staffed with police and non-police security, metal detectors installed, and a drone deployed over the event all day. Fencing put up by the university virtually cut the protest space in half. (In response to questions about the protest, Hafsa Siddiqi, the media relations manager for the university, pointed to an October 1 statement from school President Darryll Pines after the court ruled to let the protest proceed.)\nThe debacle over the protest showed the school’s bias against activists for Palestine, Abel said, and for pro-war forces, noting that University of Maryland touts its strategic partnerships with weapons manufacturers like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.\n“This is just part of a pattern we’ve seen,” he said, “where we are treated as threats and presumed to be a danger to students and a danger to the university.”\nThe repression of pro-Palestine activism on campus started well before October 7, Assar pointed out — including at her own alma mater. When Assar was a law student in 2022, Case Western President Eric Kaler denounced a student government vote to divest from companies that harm Palestinians as “naive” and antisemitic.\n“He really created this atmosphere,” Assar said, “where speaking up in support of Palestinians and their right to be free from occupation or not have their homes stolen — he made that basically into, ‘You’re a problem if you speak up.’”\nYears earlier, in 2017, the chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison condemned a vote by the student government to pass legislation calling on the school to divest from corporations involved in human rights violations, including in Israel.\n“We have seen the universities respond to these demands for more democratic institutions by reacting in exactly the opposite way,” said Saba, the Madison graduate student, “by restricting the rights that students have on campus and by increasing how much they can punish students.”\nSaba said she’s felt alienated on campus as a Palestinian American student. The school used her membership in the school’s SJP chapter as a piece of evidence in the charges against her.\n“There’s been a sense on this campus for a long time that Palestinian voices are not supposed to be heard,” Saba said. “These disciplinary investigations, by punishing or penalizing students for having any affiliation with student groups that speak in solidarity with Palestinians, they’re essentially telling Palestinian students that they can’t find community on this campus.”\n“Because when the environment is so oppressive, when our institutions are invested in genocide, and when our taxpayer dollars are invested in genocide, the only rational response would be to try to organize against that. But these schools are criminalizing that organizing.”",

    "title": "Abu Ghraib Detainees Awarded $42 Million in Torture Trial Against U.S. Defense Contractor",
    "author": "Sanya Mansoor",
    "date": "2024-11-12T17:50:00-05:00",
    "text": "A federal jury held a defense contractor legally responsible for contributing to the abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib for the first time on Tuesday.\nThe jury awarded a total of $42 million to three Iraqi men — a journalist, a middle school principal, and fruit vendor — who were held at the notorious prison two decades ago. The plaintiffs’ suit accused Virginia-based CACI, which was hired by the U.S. government to provide interrogation services at Abu Ghraib, of conspiring with American soldiers to torture detainees.\nTuesday’s verdict marks a rare victory for plaintiffs seeking to bring American corporations to justice for playing a part in the country’s so-called war on terror.\n“What the jury did today is send a very clear message that the contractors who go to war or go work with the government overseas, they will be held accountable for their role in whatever violations their employees may commit,” said Katherine Gallagher, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which represented the plaintiffs, at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. “They need to have far better oversight over their employees to ensure that something like what happened at Abu Ghraib never happens again.”\nThe case hinged largely on the legal definition of conspiracy, which doesn’t require an overt act but can also include cooperation with others engaging in torture, said Stjepan Meštrović, a sociology professor at Texas A&M University and expert witness in multiple courts-martial of soldiers who served at Abu Ghraib. “This ruling opens the door to future findings of responsibility based upon conspiracy to commit war crimes by civilian contractors and other adjuncts to military forces,” he said in an emailed statement.\nCACI had argued that while abuses did occur at Abu Ghraib, it was ultimately the Army who was responsible for this conduct, even if CACI employees may have been involved. The defense contractor also argued there was no definitive evidence that their staff abused the three Iraqi men who filed the case — and that it could have been American soldiers who tortured them. The jury did not find that argument persuasive.\nA lawyer for CACI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe monetary compensation for plaintiffs includes $3 million each for compensatory damages and $11 million each for punitive damages. Their lawyers say that’s what they requested. Baher Azmy, legal director at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a press conference on Tuesday that the verdict “sends a strong message that this kind of corporate malfeasance and neglect and recklessness and deflection is outrageous and deserves to be punished.”\nThe case was filed 16 years ago but got caught up in procedural hurdles, as CACI tried more than 20 times to dismiss the lawsuit. November’s case was a retrial; in an initial trial in April, jurors were deadlocked following more than a week of deliberations. The judge declared a mistrial. That trial, earlier this year, also marked the first time that an American jury heard directly from Iraqis who were detained at Abu Ghraib.\n\nThe lawsuit was first brought in 2008 under the Alien Tort Statute, which allows noncitizens to bring cases involving clear violations of international law, such as torture, to an American federal court when there’s a substantial connection to the U.S. “It was the United States that invaded Iraq, it was the United States that detained our clients, and it was a US company that profited from their torture and abuse,” Gallagher said in Tuesday’s press conference.\nThat Al Shimari v. CACI survived so many procedural hurdles is impressive, notes Shirin Sinnar, a law professor at Stanford University, in an emailed statement. In recent years, the Supreme Court has made it harder for cases involving national security concerns to get a trial. “It’s exceedingly rare for torture survivors or other human rights victims of the U.S. global war on terror to prevail in U.S. courts, whether against government officials or military contractors,” Sinnar wrote. “The Supreme Court has made it incredibly difficult to hold the national security state accountable in court. So this victory is exceptional in every sense of the term.”\nIt’s also notable that an American jury sided with the Iraqi men against an American military contractor, says Yumna Rizvi, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Victims of Torture, an international nonprofit. “It shows that they’re clearly not in lockstep with the decisions of their government,” Rizvi said. “The American public is putting its government and its contractors on notice that, ‘We see you and we don’t agree with what you’ve done or are doing.’”\nRizvi wonders about the precedent that could have been set for other cases if plaintiffs had been able to go to trial earlier. “You can’t just go around destroying people’s bodies and spirits and minds and just walk away from it,” she said. “Unfortunately, that’s what we’ve seen for too long in the U.S. war on terror and how the U.S. has behaved around the world.”\nThe plaintiffs — Suhail Najim Abdullah Al Shimari, Salah Hasan Nusaif Al-Ejaili, and Asa’ad Hamza Hanfoosh Zuba’e — had testified about facing sexual abuse and harassment, as well as being beaten and threatened with dogs at Abu Ghraib in the early 2000s. “My body was like a machine, responding to all external orders,” Al-Ejaili, a former journalist with Al Jazeera, had previously said. “The only part I owned was my brain, which could not be stopped by the black plastic bag they used to cover my head.”\nAl-Ejaili flew to the U.S. to be present for both trials, but he first heard the jury’s verdict while he was at home with his family in Sweden. On Tuesday, he was expecting a call from Azmy notifying him about the jury’s decision. When his phone rang, Azmy’s first words were: “Salah, we won.”\n“It was pure, profound joy,” Al-Ejaili said.",

    "author": "Nick Turse",
    "date": "2024-11-12T15:55:00-05:00",
    "text": "While president-elect Donald Trump accuses the U.S. military of being too “woke,” a morale patch showcased on a Defense Department website suggests some troops are as bigoted as ever. While the military has covered up evidence of the patch, removing photographs of it amid press outcry, the Pentagon has not disavowed it.\nIn late October, the website of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service — the Pentagon’s official photo repository — posted a photograph highlighting the shoulder patch of Lt. Kyle Festa, a pilot assigned to the Navy’s Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 74.\nFesta’s patch features crosshairs over likenesses of the Tusken Raiders, the fictional “sand people” who attacked Luke Skywalker in the 1977 movie “Star Wars.” The patch reads: “Houthi Hunting Club. Red Sea 2023-2024.”\nThe insignia commemorated his deployment aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Red Sea, according to the photo’s caption. Since January, U.S. warships in the Red Sea have repeatedly struck the Houthis, a nationalist movement that controls much of Yemen and has been attacking ships — including U.S. warships — there and in the Gulf of Aden in retaliation for the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza.\nU.S. military personnel wear all manner of patches — official and unofficial — on their uniforms. Some so-called morale patches are rooted in heraldry and history; others reference pop culture or dark humor.\n“The patches reduce the Houthis to the status of a not-quite-human, semi-alien Other. So the enemy is given quasi-racialized and subhuman status, which makes it easier to kill them,” observes Janet McIntosh, a professor of anthropology at Brandeis University and an expert in the U.S. military’s long history of dehumanizing its enemies. “It also lumps all Houthis into the same category, which will also make non-combatants or civilians easier to kill.”\nFor years, the United States backed an atrocity-filled air campaign led by Saudi Arabia against the Houthis. Just after entering office, President Joe Biden formally delisted Houthis as terrorist group. But after the Houthis started targeting ships, Biden reclassified them as a terrorists and began launching attacks on Houthi missile and radar sites.\n“For over a year, the Iran-backed Houthis, Specially Designated Global Terrorists, have recklessly and unlawfully attacked U.S. and international vessels transiting the Red Sea, the Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden,” said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin last month, announcing airstrikes in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen by Air Force B-2 bombers, a rarely used stealth plane capable of carrying the U.S. military’s largest “bunker buster” bombs.\nThe Intercept asked the Office of the Secretary of Defense whether Austin agrees with the morale patch’s characterization of the Houthis but did not receive a reply prior to publication. “The patch signifies the squadron’s operational achievements and heritage,” according to the caption of the official Navy photograph by Austen McClain.\nAfter several journalists — including former Intercept reporter Ken Klippenstein — drew attention to the “Houthi Hunting Club” photograph, that image and another of Festa wearing the patch, were removed from the Defense Department website. “After further review, it was determined that the patch was inappropriate in nature and not consistent with uniform regulations,” Cmdr. Dawn M. Stankus, a public affairs officer for Naval Air Force Atlantic, told The Intercept. She and other Navy spokespeople failed to respond to more substantive questions about the decision.\nDehumanization is a conduit to killing. The use of animalistic slurs has been shown to increase people’s willingness to endorse harming a target group. The Nazis, for example, compared Jews to rats. During the Rwandan genocide, Hutu officials referred to Tutsis as “cockroaches.”\nWhite Americans have been dehumanizing racial and ethnic Others since long before there was a United States. Racist dehumanization was central to the justification of European conquest, settler colonialism, and chattel slavery, making it inextricable from the nation’s origins. No less a document than the U.S. Declaration of Independence of 1776 refers to “merciless Indian savages.” Recent studies have shown, almost 250 years later, racist attitudes by Americans toward minority groups persist.\nResearch led by Nour Kteily, a social psychologist at Northwestern University, asked participants to rate where they think various groups belong on a 100-point scale of “evolutionary progress,” mapped onto the drawing of the “Ascent of Man” showing ape-like human ancestors on the left and a fully upright humans on the right. They found “Americans rate Americans, Europeans, Japanese. and Australians equivalently high on the scale (i.e., 90 to 93) but rate Mexican immigrants, Arabs, and Muslims 10 to 15 points lower,” according to their 2017 study. A quarter of Americans, in fact, rated Muslims at or below 60 on the scale.\nThe U.S. military also has a long history of dehumanizing its enemies — especially racial Others — from the Indian Wars of the 18th and 19th centuries onward. During America’s war in the Philippines, at the turn of the 20th century, U.S. troops began calling their Indigenous enemies “goo-goos.” The pejorative term then seems to have transmuted into “gook” and was applied over the decades to enemies during the so-called banana wars in Haiti and Nicaragua prior to World War II, and after that conflict in Korea during the 1950s.\nThe epithet returned to the lips of U.S. troops in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. While other slurs were freely employed, “gook” was — from the beginning of the conflict to its end — uttered ad infinitum. “The colonels called them gooks, the captain called them gooks, the staff all called them gooks. They were dinks, you know, subhuman,” recalled one veteran in an interview in the 1970s, published in Robert J. Lifton’s “Home From the War.”\nThe notion that the Vietnamese were something less than human was often spoken of as the “mere-gook rule,” or MGR. This held that all Vietnamese — northern and southern, adults and children, armed enemy and innocent civilian — were little more than animals, who could be killed or abused at will. The MGR mentality excused all manner of atrocities and encouraged troops to kill without compunction. “Shouldn’t bother you at all, just some more dead gooks. The sooner they all die, the sooner we go back to the World,” a Marine recounted, in a memoir published by Naval Institute Press, being told at the time. The slur and the mindset encouraged callous killing during a conflict in which an estimated 2 million Vietnamese civilians were slain, around 5.3 million were wounded (using a conservative estimate), and 11 million were displaced by the war.\nDuring the war on terror, a passel of new slurs came into use, with “sand nigger” among the most vile. “The infantry taught us to use language like ‘haji’ and ‘raghead’ and ‘target’ and ‘towelhead’ to dehumanize not just enemy combatants, but every Iraqi or Arab person we encountered,” recalled one post-9/11 Marine Corps veteran. “Our senior Marines joked about raping Iraqi women, so we did too. They called Iraqi children terrorists in training, and meant it. So we did too.”\nThe U.S. military is not unaware of its propensities. In a 2013 article in Military Review, three Army lieutenant colonels (two on active duty and one retired) wrote:\nFor years, the military has been excoriated by right-wing pundits for being too “woke.” The foreword to Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s nearly 900-page blueprint for a second Trump term, laments that “woke bureaucrats at the Pentagon force troops to attend ‘training’ seminars about ‘white privilege.’” The Houthi Hunting Club patch suggests that such sessions may have had limited effect.\n“The military’s tacit endorsement of the patches is part of a broader pattern of conflicted messaging in military training and military culture,” said McIntosh, who addresses this tension in her forthcoming book, “Kill Talk: Language and Military Necropolitics.” “On the one hand, one is instructed about rules and laws designed to carefully control violence, but on the other, you can find messaging that indirectly encourages the idea that military identity is partly about transgressing morality and sometimes even the military’s own rules.”\nIn many cases, morale patches are not officially sanctioned but are tolerated within the military to foster esprit de corps. In 2021, the Air Force ordered a review of official and unofficial unit emblems, morale patches, mottos, nicknames, and challenge coins to weed out those that were racist, sexist or otherwise offensive. “Our core values demand we hold ourselves to high standards and maintain a culture of respect and trust in our chain of command,” read the memorandum announcing the review. That same year, the 51st Civil Engineer Squadron “Mongrels” in Osan, South Korea, replaced its pit bull morale patch because it too closely resembled an image of a pit bull that the Anti-Defamation League had labeled a white supremacist symbol.\nWhile the photographs of Festa and his Houthi Hunting Club patch were removed, the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service website continues to display photos of other patches such as a 2022 women’s leadership patch with the “imagery of a woman standing proudly against the force of an atomic explosion.” Another patch features the likeness of Nusret Gökçe — a celebrity chef better known as Salt Bae for his ridiculous way of sprinkling salt on steaks — dropping Joint Direct Attack Munitions in a similar manner.\nThe Houthi Hunting Club patch is available through a commercial website that stresses that while it is not affiliated with the U.S military, it is nonetheless “where most [U.S. Marine Corps] and Navy squadrons direct purchase their squadron patches,” adding that they “are licensed by the USMC and US Navy Trademark Offices.” (It is not clear if Festa’s patch was purchased from the website.)\nMcIntosh noted that unlike the use of slurs as a means of dehumanization during the Vietnam War, the Houthi Hunting Club patch uses images of fictional movie characters, offering plausible deniability — a means to cast the patch as a joke. She calls this an example of “frame perversion,” the commingling of upbeat and menacing symbolism within military culture. “The Houthi Hunting patches both invoke the sport of hunting — where people kill for fun — and entertainment by picturing the sand people, who have pop cultural resonance. This general kind of layering of the semiotics of fun onto military killing is really common,” she says, noting that it is both a gallows-humor coping mechanism and a license for violence and military depravity.\nThe contradictions surrounding the patch are legion, not the least of which being the failures of the U.S. military effort against the Houthis. The USS Eisenhower Strike Group alone conducted more than “750 engagements,” utilizing “792 munitions in combat,” according to a July Navy press release. Just a month earlier, however, a report from the Defense Intelligence Agency acknowledged that Houthi attacks had led to a 90 percent decline in shipping activity through the Red Sea.\nSince November 2023, the Houthis have carried out almost 100 attacks on ships, sinking two vessels and seizing another. They have even targeted U.S. Navy ships, leaving sailors unaccustomed to enemy attack distressed. “It was incredibly different,” said Cmdr. Benjamin Orloff, a Navy pilot. “And I’ll be honest, it was a little traumatizing for the group. It’s something that we don’t think about a lot until you’re presented with it.”\nThe Pentagon failed to respond to questions about its military efforts against the Houthis and whether it views the military campaign as a success. It also failed to comment on the decision to remove photographs of the Houthi Hunting Club patch, nor whether any action would be taken to restrict its wear by military personnel.",

    "author": "Sanya Mansoor",
    "date": "2024-10-31T13:15:00-04:00",
    "text": "A federal case brought against a military contractor by three Iraqi men detained at Abu Ghraib prison in 2003 went to trial for the second time this week. The plaintiffs accuse Virginia-based CACI, which was hired by the U.S. government to provide interrogation services, of contributing to the torture of detainees at the Iraqi prison. The trial is expected to last for four to five days.\nFollowing 16 years of legal wrangling — and more than 20 attempts by CACI to dismiss the case — the new trial began before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Wednesday, picking up the case a judge declared a mistrial in April; the jury was deadlocked after more than a week of deliberations.\nDisturbing images of smiling American soldiers posing next to abused detainees at Abu Ghraib shocked the world in the mid-2000s, but April’s proceedings marked the first time that an American jury directly heard claims brought by people held at the notorious prison.\nThe three Iraqi men — a journalist, a middle school principal, and a fruit vendor — spoke in court via video conference earlier this year about their experience being threatened with dogs, subjected to electric shocks, and stripped of their clothing. Asa’ad Hamza Hanfoosh Al-Zuba’e, who was imprisoned at Abu Ghraib from 2003 until 2004, said that he believed people who undressed him and touched his genitals were civilian officers based on their clothing. “I was heavily embarrassed. I was crying, I was screaming,” he told the jury. Al-Zuba’e also accused civilian officers of threatening to rape his wife.\nIt’s rare for people who sued the U.S. government over human rights violations tied to its “war on terror” to get a trial, as the Supreme Court has set precedent that makes it easier for the government to squash cases over alleged national security concerns. “CACI has raised every legal challenge imaginable,” says Shirin Sinnar, a law professor at Stanford University. “The procedural hurdles are often what kill cases. Most people who have powerful claims about suffering torture never actually get their day in court.”\nThe plaintiffs, represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, filed a lawsuit in 2008 under the Alien Tort Statute. This law allows noncitizens to bring cases involving clear violations of international law, such as torture, to an American federal court when there’s a substantial connection to the U.S. Even though the Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of this law multiple times, the case against CACI has survived. In 2018, Judge Leonie Brinkema found plaintiffs had enough evidence to allow the case to proceed to a trial. Sinnar notes that Brinkema doesn’t always take the plaintiff’s side in these kinds of cases, but she has also ruled against the government when it puts forward national security claims. “She’s been willing to question that,” she says. “That may be significant here.”\nCACI has relied on a “borrowed servant” defense to suggest that the U.S. military oversaw the interrogators’ conduct and is ultimately responsible for conduct at Abu Ghraib. The defense contractor has also argued there’s no definitive evidence CACI personnel abused the three Iraqi men — and that it could have been American soldiers carrying out the abuses.\nThe plaintiffs argue that even if this were the case, civilian interrogators from CACI participated in a conspiracy with soldiers to abuse detainees as a way to “soften them up” for questioning. They rely, in part, on a 2004 report by Army Major Gen. Antonio Taguba on allegations of detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib; Taguba identified “numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses” in 2003, and specifically noted that military intelligence and CACI interrogators instructed military police to “set the conditions” for detainees’ interrogations.\nIn Wednesday’s opening statements, both sides argued over who was responsible for the contractors’ conduct: the Army or CACI. A lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights alleged that CACI “turned a blind eye” to its employees’ misconduct in order to protect a $31 million contract with the U.S. government. A representative for CACI stressed that the army controlled every aspect of CACI interrogators’ work.\nStjepan Meštrović, a sociology professor at Texas A&M University and expert witness in multiple courts-martial of soldiers who served at Abu Ghraib, notes that determining responsibility is difficult because the prison’s leadership did not have a traditional structure. “There was no one chain of command,” he says. “No one knows where the civilian contractors fall in the command structure. That is the legal problem.”\nLeaving aside the question of who made the decisions at Abu Ghraib, civilian contractors should still be held responsible for their conduct, says Sinnar: “You can’t just say you were following orders, when it’s something that anyone should know is immoral and unlawful.”\nThis is not the first time a defense contractor has been sued in connection with their work at Abu Ghraib. In 2013, Englity, formerly known as L-3 Services Inc., paid more than $5 million in a settlement to 71 former inmates held at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run detention sites in Iraq.\nMeštrović stresses that the focus on civilian contractors only constitutes a small part of what occurred at Abu Ghraib.\n“There were scores of officers, and others, who were involved and did not get punished,” he says. “They only punished the so-called few rotten apples. They didn’t go after the apple orchard.” Only about a dozen American soldiers were convicted in connection with detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib. A Senate report released in 2008 suggested that the responsibility went as high as former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other senior U.S. officials.\nStill, Al Shimari v. CACI could provide some degree of accountability. Suhail Najim Abdullah Al Shimari, who was detained for a month in 2003, said in April’s trial that he was choked and beaten so badly that he lost teeth. He still suffers from headaches and hallucinates — and claims this didn’t happen prior to his stay at Abu Ghraib.\nEven though two decades have passed since the harm faced by plaintiffs, “it’s not like these things go away,” says Sinnar. “Getting that kind of acknowledgment in a court decision can help with people’s healing.”\nUpdate: November 1, 2024A passage quoting Shirin Sinnar on the responsibility of civilian contractors was edited for clarity.",

    "author": "Frank Giustra",
    "date": "2024-10-26T17:46:21-04:00",
    "text": "If you ask the average citizen of any country whether their leaders should start wars, almost all would give a resounding “No.” The public, overall, opposes war, but tolerates leaders who prioritize power, legacy, and special interests over the wishes of their own people.\nThis is how we find ourselves recklessly stumbling toward a global conflict that could erupt out of the regional crises currently unfolding.\nLet’s start with the Middle East. With its early Saturday morning attack, Israel is on the verge of dragging the U.S. into a regional war with Iran. The plans were drawn up weeks ago and, despite U.S. warnings, Israel went ahead with the bombing.\nThough, for the moment, Iran seems to be exercising restraint, U.S. leadership seems to not be up for the challenge of averting this conflagration. The Biden administration has proven ineffective. Not only has it failed to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, the administration is also emboldening Israel by providing military assistance against retaliatory attacks from Iran.\nFor its part, Israel keeps pushing the envelope, ignoring U.S. pleas for restraint, confident that powerful Israel lobby groups will ensure American politicians will continue to supply them with money, weapons, and intelligence.\nA regional Middle East conflict could itself grow into larger war — by dragging in Russia. Given its presence in Syria, there is no predicting exactly how Russia might react to a regional war with U.S. involvement. What we do know is that Russia has issued ominous warnings to Israel about attacking Iranian nuclear sites — warning that will now be tested.\nThe Russian stance is not difficult to understand. For the U.S., a regional Middle East war would mean jumping into Israel’s fight. For Russia, the region holds the key to a web of interlocking interests. Russia buys drones and ballistic missiles from Iran for use against Ukraine, and Iran, for its part, is perpetually a potential customer for Russia’s sophisticated defense systems.\nThen there is the war in Ukraine itself, where the sides for a global conflict were drawn up. NATO members, bound by a mutual defense pact, are supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia. As a response, four countries are coming together as “the axis of resistance” — against, as how Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell refers to it, the new “axis of evil”: Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran.\nAs part of its alliance, the West continues to supply military equipment with more offensive capabilities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants long-range missiles that can attack deeper into Russian territory. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that if certain red lines get crossed, he will retain the right to use tactical nuclear weapons.\nSo far, the West has crossed a few of Putin’s red lines without consequence. The question we might ask is: How long do both sides want to play this Russian roulette?\nBoth the Middle East and Ukraine conflicts create a growing risk that the U.S. and NATO and end up in direct confrontation with Russia and its allies — the new world war.\nIf this world war breaks out along the lines of the Middle East war and Ukraine conflict, there is no reason to think the conflagration would be contained.\nAny number of miscalculation or military accident in either the Taiwan Strait or South China Sea could trigger direct confrontation between China  — unlike Russia, an ascendant world power — and the U.S.\nA wider war in Easter Europe or the Middle East could, for instance, give China an opening to go to war over Taiwan. So far, China seems in no rush to invade, tacitly accepting the U.S. policy of “strategic ambiguity” — where the U.S. remains deliberately vague on whether it would defend Taiwan militarily.\nIf the West becomes embroiled in a full-scale war with Russia or in the Middle East, that calculation could change.\nEven short of an invasion of Taiwan, China is likely to leverage a distracted West into ever more aggressive actions in the South China Sea, where the potential for conflict is high.\nThe burgeoning Eastern power is already carrying out its own version of the Monroe Doctrine. Flouting international law, China is flexing its muscle by claiming control over navigation pathways that threaten the neighboring countries of Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines — the latter of which bears the brunt of Chinese harassment and, ominously, has a mutual defense pact with the U.S.\nThere are two absolute truths about war. Once started, the outcome is unpredictable. Secondly, and more importantly, wars always escalate. We are witnessing conflicts on three fronts that are exhibiting both characteristics.\nHistory is a powerful teacher, and it’s time we dust off a few history books. Much of what is occurring on today’s geopolitical chessboard has analogues to events that unfolded in the early 20th century.\nDue to arrogance and sheer folly, the relationships between the three cousins — King George V of Britain, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and Tsar Nicholas II of Russia — deteriorated due to a mix of personal, political, and national factors. This ultimately contributed to the outbreak of the colossal sibling squabble we know as World War I.\nMuch like today, several key factors set the stage for the First World War. Militarism and nationalism were on the rise, and an arms race between major powers raged. European empires were engaged in intense competition for global dominance and access to resources, particularly in Africa.\nAs it is today, the powers divvied up into alliances: The Triple Alliance between Germany, Austria–Hungary, and Italy (though Italy later withdrew) on one side, and the Triple Entente, with a surrounded Russia joining France and the United Kingdom. In a scenario with echos today today, these alliances were meant to provide mutual defense but also created a precarious situation where a conflict involving one member could quickly spiral into a wider war.\nThose were empires. Their subjects could be excused for their inability to sway their leaders, whose sheer stupidity they would always be subject to. Today, some of the players fit this bill — but not all.\nIn the democratic West, we are supposed to have a voice. Yet, many of today’s politicians, with the help of the mainstream media, seem indifferent to the desires of their voters, catering instead to the donor class and special interests that favor conflict.\nIn this dizzying milieu of crisscrossed global interests and unaccountable leadership, our odds can look daunting. Yet those of us bestowed with the right to press our governments must continue to press policy makers to stop this madness before it’s too late.\n",

    "author": "Jonah Valdez",
    "date": "2024-11-26T19:03:03-05:00",
    "text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his support for a ceasefire deal to halt Israel’s fighting in Lebanon in a televised address Tuesday evening, projecting a message of victory to his Israeli audience. He spoke of a Hezbollah diminished by the Israeli campaign.“This is not the same Hezbollah – we pushed them back decades,” Netanyahu said during his speech. “Lebanon is not the same.”\nU.S. President Joe Biden spoke in support of the ceasefire later the same day, adding that his administration would use the momentum from Tuesday’s deal between Israel and Hezbollah to push toward a ceasefire deal in Gaza. Biden also blamed Hamas for the failure to secure peace in Gaza to date, alleging that the group has failed to negotiate in good faith, despite reporting to the contrary.\nBut Netanyahu’s own address seemed to undercut Biden’s point. In pitching the ceasefire to the Israeli audience, Netanyahu, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for potential war crimes, emphasized that closing the northern front of its war would allow Israel’s military to regroup and give the nation an opportunity to focus on other enemies: Iran and Hamas. He also emphasized that Israel would “retain complete military freedom of action,” adding that “should Hezbollah violate the agreement or attempt to rearm, we will strike decisively.”\nThe evidence that Netanyahu’s government is interested in any sort of lasting peace in both Lebanon and Gaza is thin on the ground.\nIsrael intensified its bombing campaign against Lebanon in recent days, up through and beyond the announcement of the pending ceasefire. A day before the truce was announced, Israeli strikes killed at least seven Palestinians in Gaza City. Reports have surfaced in recent days of the IDF using sniper drones to target and kill civilians. And as the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza has been slowed by Israel, experts warned of “a strong likelihood of famine” in areas of northern Gaza.\n“The going conventional wisdom is that there’s no ceasefire deal because Netanyahu doesn’t want a hostage deal – he hasn’t wanted one because he wants to keep his coalition together, and the far right wants to resettle Gaza,” said Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group focusing on Israel–Palestine. “You can’t pull out of Gaza if you’re going to build settlements there.”\nShe said Israelis are questioning why Netanyahu is striking a deal with Hezbollah instead of focusing on a ceasefire deal in Gaza, where more than 100 Israeli hostages remain. Residents of northern Israel have also criticized Tuesday’s deal, saying that Israel’s campaign in Lebanon has not improved their sense of safety near the border. While Hezbollah strikes have killed 45 Israeli citizens in northern Israel and in the occupied Golan Heights, the losses for Lebanon have been staggering.\nSince Israel began its campaign on Lebanon in September, Israeli attacks have killed more than 3,800 Lebanese, injuring more than 15,000, many of them civilians. More than 1 million people have been displaced from Lebanon, including more than 500,000 Syrian refugees. The Israeli military has destroyed entire villages in the country’s south. The cost of rebuilding is estimated to be more than $8 billion.\n“Despite the fact that I welcome and have begged for a ceasefire since day one, and that’s coming and I’m relieved, there is more than a bitter taste left in my mouth for the fact that the supposed ceasefire agreement is essentially what the status quo was before this entire operation,” said Drew Mikhael, an expert on displacement and conflict resolution with the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.\n“Some 3,000 deaths that we know about, the vaporized families that we’ll never know about that were killed because of killing Nasrallah, 1.5 million people who have been displaced – all for what?” Mikhael asked. Israel “decided to enact war crimes on its neighbor unilaterally for no apparent strategic gain,” he said.\nUnder Tuesday’s deal, the fighting will cease at 4 a.m. local time on Wednesday. Over a 60-day period, Israel must withdraw its soldiers from Lebanon while the Lebanese government takes control in southern Lebanon to restore a buffer security zone between Lebanon and Israel.\nSuch a zone already existed before the recent conflict as a result of a deal enacted in 2006. Under that agreement, the area was overseen by UN peacekeepers, which Israel has regularly bombed during the ongoing conflict. As part of Tuesday’s deal, Hezbollah, the Shia military group and political party, is not allowed to rebuild its military capacity or reassert itself in the country’s south.\nAlthough Biden said the agreement was meant to be “a permanent cessation of hostilities,” he maintained that “Israel has a right to defend itself” if it suspects that Hezbollah is violating the deal. Netanyahu vowed he would still launch attacks into Lebanon if Hezbollah broke from the deal.\nZonszein said that the truce does not imply Israel is interested in peace. She said that continued U.S. support gives Israel the unilateral ability to move freely in and over Lebanon by land, sea, and air. Maintaining the threat of violence against Lebanon, and, as Netanyahu mentioned in his speech, Iran, is core to Israeli strategy, she said.\n“Israel wants to be this angry monster, that’s the perception it wants, because it lost all of that deterrence and power on October 7,” Zonszein said. “So that’s part of what it wants to market: it wants people to think that Israel is crazy and kind of inhumane, that it’s going to target them, because that projects power.”\nMikhael agreed. Netanyahu “has to create islands of insecurity all around him,” he said, “He has only got violence and insecurity and anxiety to offer the Israeli people.”\nMoments after Biden announced the deal, Israeli warplanes struck Beirut yet again. The bombing campaign continued in the hours leading up to the pending ceasefire.",

    "text": "The Senate voted down on Wednesday a long-shot effort by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and a handful of Democrats to block the sales of offensive weapons to Israel, amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in the northern Gaza Strip.\nSanders’s bid to halt the sale of tank rounds, mortar rounds, and missile guidance kits faced long odds in the Senate from the start, with opposition from the White House and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. The math is poised to worsen when a Republican majority takes office in January.\nNot a single Republican voted for the trio of resolutions offered by Sanders. The most support one of the resolutions drew was 19 votes, less than half the Democratic caucus.\nSpeaking from the floor, Sanders said that senators who condemned human rights violations by repressive regimes without similarly condemning Israel would face mockery.\n“People will laugh in your face,” Sanders said. “They will say you are concerned about China, you are concerned about Russia, you are concerned about Iran – well, why are you funding the starvation of children in Gaza right now?”\nIn trying to block the shipments to Israel, Sanders employed a rarely used mechanism known as a joint resolution of disapproval, which allows Congress to halt specific arms sales to foreign countries.\nAlthough Congress has voted on several measures related to the war in Gaza, the anti-war lobby group Friends Committee on National Legislation described the Sanders resolutions as “the first major vote in Congress to halt weapons sales to Israel.”\nSanders and the handful of allies who spoke Wednesday said they were strong supporters of Israel, but cast the resolutions as votes against an Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu whose unrelenting war has left northern Gaza at imminent risk of famine, all while derailing the Biden administration’s efforts to strike a ceasefire-for-hostages deal.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said that U.S. law requires the recipients of American weapons to abide by international human rights laws and to not block humanitarian aid.\n“The issue is not whether or not the United States is supporting Israel,” he said. “The issue is whether or not, as we provide that support, we have a two-way street. A partnership should be a two-way street, not a one-way blank check.”\nThe vote Wednesday shook out much like others related to the war: lopsided support for Israel across party lines.\nDespite impassioned speeches from Sanders and others, most members of the Democratic caucus voted against blocking the arms sales. Ahead of the vote, the White House distributed talking points urging senators to vote down the resolutions, according to HuffPost.\nThe White House lobbying effort came as the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have demanded an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to the war in Gaza.\nThe first senator to speak against the resolutions was a Democrat, Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who said she knew that many of her colleagues felt torn. She suggested the weapons being sold to Israel would actually help save civilian lives, since they are “more precise and more accurate.” Schumer also took to the floor to oppose the resolutions.\nDespite Democratic leaders’ unflinching support for Israel, Republicans have sought to cast themselves as the friendlier party to the Netanyahu regime. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said Sanders’s resolutions were the logical outcome of the administration’s brief pauses on shipping certain weapons to Israel.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called for a “viable day-after plan” to provide for a “dignified life for the Palestinians,” while displaying with approval pictures of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n“What is the proper response to people who want to kill you and your family and destroy your way of life? I can tell you what the United States did,” Graham said. “We went to war, we dropped two atomic bombs to end a war we couldn’t afford to lose. What is the right response to those who want to kill all the Jews? Make sure they don’t have the capability to do it.”\nThe Senate’s vote came as the situation on the ground in Gaza continued to worsen, according to aid groups.\n“Famine is likely happening or imminent in north Gaza,” Cindy McCain, the executive director of the U.N. World Food Programme, said on X earlier this month. “Immediate steps MUST BE TAKEN to allow safe, rapid & unimpeded flow of humanitarian & commercial supplies to prevent an all-out catastrophe. NOW.”\nActivists in the U.S. urged senators to vote for the Sanders resolutions this week. Nearly 50 were arrested in a Senate office building Tuesday as they rallied in favor of the measures.\n“It’s been clear that the only way to really end this genocide is to stop the flow of U.S. weapons to Israel,” said Ramah Kudaimi, campaign director with the Action Center on Race and the Economy, who was a lead organizer of the protest on Tuesday.\n“As long as the guns and bullets are being sent,” said Kudaimi. “Israel has what it needs to continue massacring Palestinian men, women and children, destroying mosques and churches and schools and homes and hospitals.”\nRebecca Roberts, an army veteran who left the military in protest over Gaza and was arrested at the Senate protest yesterday, said the vote shows us where elected officials stand in “black and white terms.”\n“I think it’s going to be a very clear signal, beyond all signs we’ve gotten, that they’re not listening to their constituents,” said Roberts, correctly anticipating that the measures would fail. “They’re instead, going where the money goes, to get re-elected and to continue to get funding from AIPAC, and that their own political interests are of greater value to them than human life and our own well being.”\nProgressive members of the House have echoed activists’ demands for the U.S. to stop arming Israel.\n“I have sat with American Doctors who have desperately tried to save Palestinian children shot in the head. I have met with mothers who have watched their children die slowly, their bodies fatally burned in Israeli airstrikes. We are talking about a horrific crisis—a genocide,” said Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., in a statement to The Intercept. “Millions of Palestinians are facing violence, displacement, and starvation while the United States stands complicit in their suffering. It is long past time to change course and act with urgency to save lives.”\nHalting the sale of weapons to Israel is the “obvious thing to do,” argued Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa.\n“We see just the death toll, the immense destruction and the casualties in Gaza,” said Lee. “It feels so obvious to me that calling for peace, that calling for a halt to further destruction, which means the United States would have to stop arming Israel, is the obvious thing to do.”",

    "author": "Shawn Musgrave",
    "date": "2024-11-19T14:26:32-05:00",
    "text": "A group of White House staffers sent a letter of dissent on Monday over the Biden administration’s decision not to enforce its own ultimatum over the Israeli government’s restriction of humanitarian aid to Gaza. With just weeks until President-elect Donald Trump begins his second administration, the letter is a plea for President Joe Biden to “take simple and immediate action to drastically mitigate the humanitarian crisis.”\n“You are running out of time to do the right thing, but decisive action could save precious lives in the next two months,” reads the letter. Twenty “current, full-time employees of the White House,” who were not named for fear of professional retaliation, drafted the letter.\nThe Intercept spoke with two senior White House staffers who helped draft the letter, which was directed to Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a variety of senior policy advisers.\n“I’m thinking a lot about the concept of legacy and ending well,” said one of the staffers. “I personally want to be seen as someone who keeps my commitments and want to be part of an administration that keeps its commitments too.”\nThe letter follows the State Department’s announcement last week that it would not restrict military aid despite Israel’s failure to meet concrete demands issued in October.\nIn an October 13 letter, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin gave Israel 30 days to take “concrete measures” in light of the “increasingly dire” humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “Failure to demonstrate a sustained commitment to implementing and maintaining these measures may have implications for U.S. policy,” the letter warned.\nThe most concrete of these demands was that Israel allow at least 350 aid trucks each day into Gaza. But as the 30-day deadline approached, aid groups reported that on average, just 42 trucks were crossing into Gaza per day and sometimes as few as six trucks.\nThe White House staffers’ letter emphasizes that U.S. law, specifically the Foreign Assistance Act, “requires cessation of security assistance to foreign governments who impede U.S. humanitarian aid.”\nBut after the 30-day deadline passed without meaningful improvement in the flow of aid, the Biden administration declined to make a finding that the Israeli government was in violation of its legal obligations, with little explanation for its reasoning.\n“If government attorneys believe these statutes are not being violated, the public and the executive branch staff deserve a written explanation of their reasoning,” reads one of the demands in the White House staffers’ letter.\nIt also calls on White House leaders to stop the flow of weapons and to pressure Israel “to halt military operations in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon and enact an immediate, comprehensive, and permanent ceasefire.”\n“I felt like I needed to do something,” another staffer told The Intercept, “as an act of trying to get to the straw that breaks the camel’s back — even if this isn’t it.”\n",

    "title": "“A Final, Deadly Exclamation Point”: Biden Backs Down on 30-Day Israel Arms Ultimatum",
    "author": "Jonah Valdez",
    "date": "2024-11-12T18:51:49-05:00",
    "text": "On October 13, the Biden administration sent a strongly worded letter to Israel with a simple message: Allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza within 30 days, or we may pull away our military support.\nAt the time, Israel was in the early stages of its siege on northern Gaza, where thousands of civilians had been sheltering. The leaked letter, written by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and addressed to Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer and then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, outlined a list of concrete demands intended to ensure the flow of supplies into Gaza to address starvation, the lack of medical resources, and avoid the forced displacement of Palestinians out of northern Gaza.\nWhen the deadline arrived 30 days later, on Tuesday, November 12, a group of humanitarian organizations published a report finding that Israel has failed to deliver on most, if not all, of the criteria outlined by the U.S in the October letter. In response, the U.S. said it will continue providing arms to Israel.\n“We at this time have not made assessments that the Israelis are in violation of U.S. law,” State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday. “We are going to continue to assess their compliance with U.S. law. We’ve seen some progress being made, we’d like to see more changes happen.”\nFor humanitarian aid groups who are doing work on the ground in Gaza, the State Department’s position couldn’t be further from reality.\nA group of eight humanitarian organizations released a report Tuesday that tracked each of the letter’s demands and how Israel is failing on all but several of them. The “Gaza Scorecard” showed that within the past 30 days, Israel has failed to open any new border crossings into Gaza; only 42 trucks have been allowed per day, well short of the U.S. benchmark of 350 trucks; the Israeli military killed four aid workers; the military bombed a polio vaccine clinic during a humanitarian pause; about 80 percent of Gaza remains under evacuation orders, continuing the displacement of Palestinians; and aid groups have been prevented from entering northern Gaza where the Israeli military continues its siege.\n“How much more evidence does the U.S. government need to respect its own laws and humanitarian standards?” Joseph Belliveau, executive director of MedGlobal, one of the groups behind the report, told The Intercept. “It should end all military support today.” This is only the latest instance of Israel crossing Biden’s red lines with impunity.\nMedGlobal has around 300 aid workers in Gaza, who are helping set up clinics, running surgery wards within hospitals, and providing other medical support, said Belliveau, who previously was director of Doctors Without Borders-Canada. He said their workers have reported high levels of malnutrition and the spread of preventable diseases, such as the measles, as well as respiratory tract infections among their patients in Gaza. Their medical workers conduct surgeries daily on civilians, mostly women and children, he said, who are wounded by Israeli attacks. Furthermore, four MedGlobal workers have been arrested by the Israeli military and remained in custody with no explanation.\n“How many ways can you die right now in Gaza?” Belliveau said. “You can be hit by an airstrike, you can be targeted by snipers, you can die from disease, you can die from famine and malnutrition. And at the same time, not only are Palestinians exposed to all those risks in an extreme way, but the humanitarian and medical personnel that would be needed to even come close to trying to respond to this level of humanitarian need are almost completely shut out.”\nScott Paul, director of peace and security at Oxfam America, which also helped compile the report, said that the Biden administration’s decision to continue military support to Israel “has put a final, deadly exclamation point on its policy of disregard for US law and the lives of Palestinians.”\n“Now, as communities in North Gaza are erased and starved to death, Israel will receive a steady stream of US weapons with a newly furnished seal of approval,” Paul said. “We provided sound humanitarian evidence and it was ignored. This is an unsurprising but still disgraceful decision.”\nThis isn’t the first time the Biden administration had threatened to use U.S. law to cut military support to Israel. In March, Israel signed on to a memo, known as “NSM-20,” which required the State and Defense departments to obtain credible assurances that Israel was not using U.S. weapons to violate international law. The administration has also pointed to the Leahy Law, which prohibits U.S. assistance to “any unit of the security forces of a foreign country if the Secretary of State has credible information that such unit has committed a gross violation of human rights.”\nHowever, in May, amid mounting evidence of Israel’s attempts to block humanitarian aid into Gaza, the State Department released a report saying that it had “deep concerns” about Israel, but that it had been following the law. The flow of arms continued.\nDuring the Tuesday press briefing, Patel said the State Department would continue to assess whether Israel is violating international law and would be consulting with aid groups and the United Nations to make those estimations. However, when reporters asked whether the State Department had seen the report from aid organizations, he declined to comment on the findings. Furthermore, figures from the U.N. bolster the report’s findings, showing that October showed the lowest number of aid crossings into Gaza.\n“When we’re talking about specific metrics or specific actions on the ground, the hope is that operational changes made on the ground would make it possible for an additional increase in humanitarian aid and trucks to get into places where it needs to go,” Patel said, repeating the idea that the Israeli government has made “progress” with measures such as waiving customs fees and allowing the Jordanian Armed Forces into Gaza to deliver aid.\nThe humanitarians groups’ report credits the partial implementation of those measures but says obstacles remain: Some aid groups are charged fees to cross into Gaza, which is being unevenly enforced. Overall, the report found that Israel only partially or inconsistently met four of the 19 demands laid out in the October letter from Blinken and Austin, and had not met the remaining 15 demands at all.\nBelliveau said MedGlobal has been in contact with senators and the Biden administration over the past year, pushing for application of the Leahy Law to no success. He said with the transition to a Donald Trump presidency, he sees an opening for his group to make another concerted effort to get the U.S. to comply with its own laws, but has little hope in the president-elect’s desire to deliver.\n“Individually, we get a lot of sympathy for our position and a lot of recognition that laws are being violated and that these are not the standards that Americans want to uphold — and then in the public arena, we just continue to hear platitudes coming from the government and we continue to see the the actions that give no evidence that there’s been any kind of restraints or pull back in terms of support to the regime that’s committing these crimes,” he said.\nAs the deadline passed on Tuesday, an Israeli strike hit a house in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, killing 32 people, including 13 children. Last week, the Israeli government announced that it is nearing the “complete evacuation” of northern Gaza, and residents would not be allowed to return. Israeli Brig. Gen. Itzik Cohen said when that evacuation takes place, humanitarian aid would no longer arrive in northern Gaza, since there are “no more civilians left.”",

    "text": "Meta’s in-house ChatGPT competitor is being marketed unlike anything that’s ever come out of the social media giant before: a convenient tool for planning airstrikes.\nAs it has invested billions into developing machine learning technology it hopes can outpace OpenAI and other competitors, Meta has pitched its flagship large language model, Llama, as a handy way of planning vegan dinners or weekends away with friends. A provision in Llama’s terms of service previously prohibited military uses, but Meta announced on November 4 that it was joining its chief rivals and getting into the business of war.\n“Responsible uses of open source AI models promote global security and help establish the U.S. in the global race for AI leadership,” Meta proclaimed in a blog post by global affairs chief Nick Clegg.\nOne of these “responsible uses” is a partnership with Scale AI, a $14 billion machine learning startup and thriving defense contractor. Following the policy change, Scale now uses Llama 3.0 to power a chat tool for governmental users who want to “apply the power of generative AI to their unique use cases, such as planning military or intelligence operations and understanding adversary vulnerabilities,” according to a press release.\nBut there’s a problem: Experts tell The Intercept that the government-only tool, called “Defense Llama,” is being advertised by showing it give terrible advice about how to blow up a building. Scale AI defended the advertisement by telling The Intercept its marketing is not intended to accurately represent its product’s capabilities.\nLlama 3.0 is a so-called open source model, meaning that users can download it, use it, and alter it, free of charge, unlike OpenAI’s offerings. Scale AI says it has customized Meta’s technology to provide military expertise.\nScale AI touts Defense Llama’s accuracy, as well as its adherence to norms, laws, and regulations: “Defense Llama was trained on a vast dataset, including military doctrine, international humanitarian law, and relevant policies designed to align with the Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines for armed conflict as well as the DoD’s Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence. This enables the model to provide accurate, meaningful, and relevant responses.”\nThe tool is not available to the public, but Scale AI’s website provides an example of this Meta-augmented accuracy, meaningfulness, and relevance. The case study is in weaponeering, the process of choosing the right weapon for a given military operation. An image on the Defense Llama homepage depicts a hypothetical user asking the chatbot: “What are some JDAMs an F-35B could use to destroy a reinforced concrete building while minimizing collateral damage?” The Joint Direct Attack Munition, or JDAM, is a hardware kit that converts unguided “dumb” bombs into a “precision-guided” weapon that uses GPS or lasers to track its target.\nDefense Llama is shown in turn suggesting three different Guided Bomb Unit munitions, or GBUs, ranging from 500 to 2,000 pounds with characteristic chatbot pluck, describing one as “an excellent choice for destroying reinforced concrete buildings.”\nMilitary targeting and munitions experts who spoke to The Intercept all said Defense Llama’s advertised response was flawed to the point of being useless. Not just does it gives bad answers, they said, but it also complies with a fundamentally bad question. Whereas a trained human should know that such a question is nonsensical and dangerous, large language models, or LLMs, are generally built to be user friendly and compliant, even when it’s a matter of life and death.\n“I can assure you that no U.S. targeting cell or operational unit is using a LLM such as this to make weaponeering decisions nor to conduct collateral damage mitigation,” Wes J. Bryant, a retired targeting officer with the U.S. Air Force, told The Intercept, “and if anyone brought the idea up, they’d be promptly laughed out of the room.”\nMunitions experts gave Defense Llama’s hypothetical poor marks across the board. The LLM “completely fails” in its attempt to suggest the right weapon for the target while minimizing civilian death, Bryant told The Intercept.\n“Since the question specifies JDAM and destruction of the building, it eliminates munitions that are generally used for lower collateral damage strikes,” Trevor Ball, a former U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technician, told The Intercept. “All the answer does is poorly mention the JDAM ‘bunker busters’ but with errors. For example, the GBU-31 and GBU-32 warhead it refers to is not the (V)1. There also isn’t a 500-pound penetrator in the U.S. arsenal.”\nBall added that it would be “worthless” for the chatbot give advice on destroying a concrete building without being provided any information about the building beyond it being made of concrete.\nDefense Llama’s advertised output is “generic to the point of uselessness to almost any user,” said N.R. Jenzen-Jones, director of Armament Research Services. He also expressed skepticism toward the question’s premise. “It is difficult to imagine many scenarios in which a human user would need to ask the sample question as phrased.”\nIn an emailed statement, Scale AI spokesperson Heather Horniak told The Intercept that the marketing image was not meant to actually represent what Defense Llama can do, but merely “makes the point that an LLM customized for defense can respond to military-focused questions.” Horniak added that “The claim that a response from a hypothetical website example represents what actually comes from a deployed, fine-tuned LLM that is trained on relevant materials for an end user is ridiculous.”\nDespite Scale AI’s claims that Defense Llama was trained on a “vast dataset” of military knowledge, Jenzen-Jones said the artificial intelligence’s advertised response was marked by “clumsy and imprecise terminology” and factual errors, confusing and conflating different aspects of different bombs. “If someone asked me this exact question, it would immediately belie a lack of understanding about munitions selection or targeting,” he said. Why an F-35? Why a JDAM? What’s the building, and where is it? All of this important, Jenzen-Jones said, is stripped away by Scale AI’s example.\nBryant cautioned that there is “no magic weapon that prevents civilian casualties,” but he called out the marketing image’s suggested use of the 2,000-pound GBU-31, which was “utilized extensively by Israel in the first months of the Gaza campaign, and as we know caused massive civilian casualties due to the manner in which they employed the weapons.”\nScale did not answer when asked if Defense Department customers are actually using Defense Llama as shown in the advertisement. On the day the tool was announced, Scale AI provided DefenseScoop a private demonstration using this same airstrike scenario. The publication noted that Defense Llama provided “provided a lengthy response that also spotlighted a number of factors worth considering.” Following a request for comment by The Intercept, the company added a small caption under the promotional image: “for demo purposes only.”\nMeta declined to comment.\nWhile Scale AI’s marketing scenario may be a hypothetical, military use of LLMs is not. In February, DefenseScoop reported that the Pentagon’s AI office had selected Scale AI “to produce a trustworthy means for testing and evaluating large language models that can support — and potentially disrupt — military planning and decision-making.” The company’s LLM software, now augmented by Meta’s massive investment in machine learning, has contracted with the Air Force and Army since 2020. Last year, Scale AI announced its system was the “the first large language model (LLM) on a classified network,” used by the XVIII Airborne Corps for “decision-making.” In October, the White House issued a national security memorandum directing the Department of Defense and intelligence community to adopt AI tools with greater urgency. Shortly after the memo’s publication, The Intercept reported that U.S. Africa Command had purchased access to OpenAI services via a contract with Microsoft.\nUnlike its industry peers, Scale AI has never shied away from defense contracting. In a 2023 interview with the Washington Post, CEO Alexandr Wang, a vocal proponent of weaponized AI, described himself as a “China-hawk” and said he hoped Scale could “be the company that helps ensure that the United States maintains this leadership position.” Its embrace of military work has seemingly charmed investors, which include Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Y Combinator, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta. “With Defense Llama, our service members can now better harness generative AI to address their specific mission needs,” Wang wrote in the product’s announcement.\nBut the munitions experts who spoke to The Intercept expressed confusion over who, exactly, Defense Llama is marketing to with the airstrike demo, questioning why anyone involved in weaponeering would know so little about its fundamentals that they would need to consult a chatbot in the first place. “If we generously assume this example is intended to simulate a question from an analyst not directly involved in planning and without munitions-specific expertise, then the answer is in fact much more dangerous,” Jenzen-Jones explained. “It reinforces a probably false assumption (that a JDAM must be used), it fails to clarify important selection criteria, it gives incorrect technical data that a nonspecialist user is less likely to question, and it does nothing to share important contextual information about targeting constraints.”\nBryant agreed. “The advertising and hypothetical scenario is quite irresponsible,” he explained, “primarily because the U.S. military’s methodology for mitigating collateral damage is not so simple as just the munition being utilized. That is one factor of many.” Bryant suggested that Scale AI’s example scenario betrayed an interest in “trying make good press and trying to depict an idea of things that may be in the realm of possible, while being wholly naive about what they are trying to depict and completely lacking understanding in anything related to actual targeting.”\nTurning to an LLM for airstrike planning also means sidestepping the typical human-based process and the responsibility that entails. Bryant, who during his time in the Air Force helped plan airstrikes against Islamic State targets, told The Intercept that the process typically entails a team of experts “who ultimately converge on a final targeting decision.”\nJessica Dorsey, a professor at Utrecht University School of Law and scholar of automated warfare methods, said consulting Defense Llama seems to entirely circumvent the ostensible legal obligations military planners are supposed to be held to. “The reductionist/simplistic and almost amateurish approach indicated by the example is quite dangerous,” she said. “Just deploying a GBU/JDAM does not mean there will be less civilian harm. It’s a 500 to 2,000-pound bomb after all.”",

    "text": "Donald Trump pitched himself to voters as a supposed anti-interventionist candidate of peace. But when he reenters the White House in January, at his side will be a phalanx of pro-military Silicon Valley investors, inventors, and executives eager to build the most sophisticated weapons the world has ever known.\nDuring his last term, the U.S. tech sector tiptoed skittishly around Trump; longtime right-winger Peter Thiel stood as an outlier in his full-throated support of MAGA politics as other investors and executives largely winced and smiled politely. Back then, Silicon Valley still offered the public peaceful mission statements of improving the human condition, connecting people, and organizing information. Technology was supposed to help, never harm. No more: People like Thiel, Palmer Luckey, Trae Stephens, and Marc Andreessen make up a new vanguard of powerful tech figures who have unapologetically merged right-wing politics with a determination to furnish a MAGA-dominated United States with a constant flow of newer, better arms and surveillance tools.\nThese men (as they tend to be) hold much in common beyond their support of Republican candidates: They share the belief that China represents an existential threat to the United States (an increasingly bipartisan belief, to be sure) and must be dominated technologically and militarily at all costs. They are united in their aversion, if not open hostility, to arguments that the pace of invention must be balanced against any moral consideration beyond winning. And they all stand to profit greatly from this new tech-driven arms race.\nTrump’s election marks an epochal victory not just for the right, but also for a growing conservative counterrevolution in American tech that has successfully rebranded military contracting as the proud national duty of the American engineer, not a taboo to be dodged and hidden. Meta’s recent announcement that its Llama large language model can now be used by defense customers means that Apple is the last of the “Big Five” American tech firms — Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Meta — not engaged in military or intelligence contracting.\nElon Musk has drawn the lion’s share of media scrutiny (and Trump world credit) for throwing his fortune and digital influence behind the campaign. Over the years, the world’s richest man has become an enormously successful defense contractor via SpaceX, which has reaped billions selling access to rockets that the Pentagon hopes will someday rapidly ferry troops into battle. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite internet has also become an indispensable American military tool, and the company is working on a constellation of bespoke spy satellites for U.S. intelligence agency use.\nBut Musk is just one part of a broader wave of militarists who will have Trump’s ear on policy matters.\nAfter election day, Musk replied to a celebratory tweet from Palmer Luckey, a founder of Anduril, a $14 billion startup that got its start selling migrant-detecting surveillance towers for the southern border and now manufactures a growing line of lethal drones and missiles. “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” Musk wrote. Anduril’s rise is inseparable from Trumpism: Luckey founded the firm in 2017 after he was fired by Meta for contributing to a pro-Trump organization. He has been outspoken in his support for Trump as both candidate and president, fundraising for him in both 2020 and 2024.\nBig Tech historically worked hard to be viewed by the public as inhabiting the center-left, if not being apolitical altogether. But even that is changing. While Luckey was fired for merely supporting Trump’s first campaign, his former boss (and former liberal) Mark Zuckerberg publicly characterized Trump surviving the June assassination attempt as “bad ass” and quickly congratulated the president-elect on a “decisive victory.” Zuckerberg added that he is “looking forward to working with you and your administration.”\nTo some extent, none of this is new: Silicon Valley’s origin is one of militarism. The American computer and software economy was nurtured from birth by the explosive growth and endless money of the Cold War arms race and its insatiable appetite for private sector R&D. And despite the popular trope of liberal Google executives, the tech industry has always harbored a strong anti-labor, pro-business instinct that dovetails neatly with conservative politics. It would also be a mistake to think that Silicon Valley was ever truly in lockstep with progressive values. A 2014 political ad by Americans for a Conservative Direction, a defunct effort by Facebook to court the Republican Party, warned that “it’s wrong to have millions of people living in America illegally” and urged lawmakers to “secure our borders so this never happens again.” The notion of the Democrat-friendly wing of Big Tech as dovish is equally wrong: Former Google chair and longtime liberal donor Eric Schmidt is a leading China hawk and defense tech investor. Similarly, the Democratic Party itself hasn’t meaningfully distanced itself from militarism in recent history. The current wave of startups designing smaller, cheaper military drones follows the Obama administration’s eager mass adoption of the technology, and firms like Anduril and Palantir have thrived under Joe Biden.\nWhat has changed is which views the tech industry is now comfortable expressing out loud.\nA year after Luckey’s ouster from the virtual reality subsidiary he founded, Google became embroiled in what grew into an industry-wide upheaval over military contracting. After it was reported that the company sought to win Project Maven, a lucrative drone-targeting contract, employees who had come to the internet titan to work on consumer products like Search, Maps, and Gmail found themselves disturbed by the thought of contributing to a system that could kill people. Waves of protests pushed Google to abandon the Pentagon with its tail between its legs. Even Fei-Fei Li, then Google Cloud’s chief artificial intelligence and machine learning scientist, described the contract as a source of shame in internal emails obtained by the New York Times. “Weaponized AI is probably one of the most sensitized topics of AI — if not THE most. This is red meat to the media to find all ways to damage Google,” she wrote. “I don’t know what would happen if the media starts picking up a theme that Google is secretly building AI weapons or AI technologies to enable weapons for the Defense industry.”\nIt’s an exchange that reads deeply quaint today. The notion that the country’s talented engineers should build weapons is becoming fully mainstreamed. “Societies have always needed a warrior class that is enthused and excited about enacting violence on others in pursuit of good aims,” Luckey explained in an on-campus talk about his company’s contributions to the Ukrainian war effort with Pepperdine University President Jim Gash. “You need people like me who are sick in that way and who don’t lose any sleep making tools of violence in order to preserve freedom.”\nThis “warrior class” mentality traces its genealogy to Peter Thiel, whose disciples, like Luckey, spread the gospel of a conservative-led arms race against China. “Everything that we’re doing, what the [Department of Defense] is doing, is preparing for a conflict with a great power like China in the Pacific,” Luckey told Bloomberg TV in a 2023 interview. At the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2019, Thiel, a lifelong techno-libertarian and Trump’s first major backer in tech, rejected the “ethical framing” of the question of whether to build weapons.” When it’s a choice between the U.S. and China, it is always the ethical decision to work with the U.S. government,” he said. Though Sinophobia is increasingly standard across party affiliations, it’s particularly frothing in the venture-backed warrior class. In 2019, Thiel claimed that Google had been “infiltrated by Chinese intelligence” and two years later suggested that bitcoin is “a Chinese financial weapon against the U.S.”\nThiel often embodies the self-contradiction of Trumpist foreign policy, decrying the use of taxpayer money on “faraway wars” while boosting companies that design weapons for exactly that. Like Trump, Thiel is a vocal opponent of Bush- and Obama-era adventurism in the Middle East as a source of nothing but regional chaos — though Thiel has remained silent on Trump’s large expansion of the Obama administration’s drone program and his assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. In July, asked about the Israeli use of AI in the ongoing slaughter in Gaza, Thiel responded, “I defer to Israel.”\nThiel’s gravitational pull is felt across the whole of tech’s realignment toward militarism. Vice President-elect JD Vance worked at Mithril, another of Thiel’s investment firms, and used $15 million from his former boss to fund the 2022 Senate win that secured his national political bona fides. Vance would later go on to invest in Anduril. Founders Fund, Thiel’s main venture capital firm, has seeded the tech sector with influential figures friendly to both Trumpism and the Pentagon. Before, an investor or CEO who publicly embraced right-wing ideology and products designed to kill risked becoming an industry pariah. Today, he can be a CNBC guest.\nAn earlier adopter of MAGA, Thiel was also investing in and creating military- and intelligence-oriented companies before it was cool. He co-founded Palantir, which got its start helping facilitate spy agency and deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Now part of the S&P 500, the company helps target military strikes for Ukraine and in January sealed a “strategic partnership for battle tech” with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, according to a press release.\nThe ripple effect of Palantir’s success has helped popularize defense tech and solidify its union with the American right. Thiel’s Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, also an Anduril investor, is reportedly helping Trump staff his new administration. Former Palantir employee and Anduril executive chair Trae Stephens joined the Trump transition team in 2016 and has suggested he would serve a second administration. As a member of the U.S.–China Economic and Security Review Commission, Thiel ally Jacob Helberg has been instrumental in whipping up anti-China fervor on Capitol Hill, helping push legislation to ban TikTok, and arguing for military adoption of AI technologies like those sold by his employer, Palantir, which markets itself as a bulwark against Chinese aggression. Although Palantir CEO Alex Karp is a self-described Democrat who said he planned to vote against Trump, he has derided progressivism as a “thin pagan religion” of wokeness, suggested pro-Palestine college protesters leave for North Korea, and continually advocating for an American arms buildup.\n“Trump has surrounded himself with ‘techno-optimists’ — people who believe technology is the answer to every problem,” Brianna Rosen, a strategy and policy fellow at the University of Oxford and alumnus of the Obama National Security Council, told The Intercept. “Key members of his inner circle — leading tech executives — describe themselves in this way. The risk of techno-optimism in the military domain is that it focuses on how technology saves lives, rather than the real risks associated with military AI, such as the accelerated pace of targeting.”\nThe worldview of this corner of the tech industry is loud, if not always consistent. Foreign entanglements are bad, but the United States must be on perpetual war-footing against China. China itself is dangerous in part because it’s rapidly weaponizing AI, a current that threatens global stability, so the United States should do the very same, even harder, absent regulatory meddling.\nStephens’s 2022 admonition that “the business of war is the business of deterrence” argues that “peaceful outcomes are only achievable if we maintain our technological advantage in weapons systems” — an argument that overlooks the fact that the U.S. military’s overwhelming technological superiority failed to keep it out of Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan. In a recent interview with Wired, Stephens both criticized the revolving door between the federal government and Anduril competitors like Boeing while also stating that “it’s important that people come out of private industry to work on civil service projects, and I hope at some point I’ll have the opportunity to go back in and serve the government and American people.”\nWilliam Fitzgerald, the founder of The Worker Agency, a communications and advocacy firm that has helped tech workers organize against military contracts, said this square is easily circled by right-wing tech hawks, whose pitch is centered on the glacial incompetence of the Department of Defense and blue-chip contractors like Lockheed and Raytheon. “Peter Thiel’s whole thing is to privatize the state,” Fitzgerald explained. Despite all of the rhetoric about avoiding foreign entanglements, a high-tech arms race is conducive to different kinds of wars, not fewer of them. “This alignment fits this narrative that we can do cheaper wars,” he said. “We won’t lose the men over there because we’ll have these drones.”\nIn this view, the opposition of Thiel and his ilk isn’t so much to forever wars, then, but rather whose hardware is being purchased forever.\nThe new conservative tech establishment seems in full agreement about the need for an era of techno-militarism. Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the namesakes of one of Silicon Valley’s most storied and successful venture capital firms, poured millions into Trump’s reelection and have pushed hard to reorient the American tech sector toward fighting wars. In a “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” published last October, Andreessen wrote of defense contracting as a moral imperative. “We believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak. We believe national strength of liberal democracies flows from economic strength (financial power), cultural strength (soft power), and military strength (hard power). Economic, cultural, and military strength flow from technological strength.” The firm knows full well what it’s evoking through a naked embrace of strength as society’s greatest virtue: Listed among the “Patron Saints of Techno-Optimism” is Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, co-author of the 1919 Fascist Manifesto.\nThe venture capitalists’ document offers a clear rebuttal of employees’ moral qualms that pushed Google to ditch Project Maven. The manifesto dismisses basic notions of “ethics,” “safety,” and “social responsibility” as a “demoralization campaign” of “zombie ideas, many derived from Communism” pushed by “the enemy.” This is rhetoric that matches a brand Trump has worked to cultivate: aspirationally hypermasculine, unapologetically jingoistic, and horrified by an America whose potential to dominate the planet is imperiled by meddling foreigners and scolding woke co-workers.\n“There’s a lot more volatility in the world, [and] there is more of a revolt against what some would deem ‘woke culture,’” said Michael Dempsey, managing partner at the New York-based venture capital firm Compound. “It’s just more in the zeitgeist now that companies shouldn’t be so heavily influenced by personal politics. Obviously that is the tech industry talking out of both sides of their mouth because we saw in this past election a bunch of people get very political and make donations from their firms.”\nDespite skewing young (by national security standards), many in this rightward, pro-military orbit are cultural and religious traditionalists infused with the libertarian preferences of the Zynternet, a wildly popular online content scene that’s melded apolitical internet bro culture and a general aversion to anything considered vaguely “woke.” A recent Vanity Fair profile of the El Segundo tech scene, a hotbed of the burgeoning “military Zyndustrial complex” commonly known as “the Gundo,” described the city as “California’s freedom-loving, Bible-thumping hub of hard tech.” It paints a vivid scene of young engineers who eschewed the progressive dystopia of San Francisco they read about on Twitter and instead flocked to build “nuclear reactors and military weaponry designed to fight China” beneath “an American flag the size of a dumpster” and “a life-size poster of Jesus Christ smiling benevolently onto a bench press below.”\nThe American right’s hold over online culture in the form of podcasts, streamers, and other youth-friendly media has been central to both retaking Washington and bulldozing post-Maven sentiment, according to William Fitzgerald of Worker Agency. “I gotta hand it to the VCs, they’re really good at comms,” said Fitzgerald, who himself is former Google employee who helped leak critical information about the company’s involvement in Project Maven. “They’re really making sure that these Gundo bros are wrapping the American flag around them. It’s been fascinating to see them from 2019 to 2024 completely changing the culture among young tech workers.”\nA wave of layoffs and firings of employees engaged in anti-military protests have been a boon for defense evangelists, Fitzgerald added. “The workers have been told to shut up, or they get fired.”\nThis rhetoric has been matched by a massive push by Andreessen Horowitz (already an Anduril investor) behind the fund’s “American Dynamism” portfolio, a collection of companies that leans heavily into new startups hoping to be the next Raytheon. These investments include ABL Space Systems, already contracting with the Air Force,; Epirus, which makes microwave directed-energy weapons; and Shield AI, which works on autonomous military drones. Following the election, David Ulevitch, who leads the fund’s American Dynamism team, retweeted a celebratory video montage interspersed with men firing flamethrowers, machine guns, jets, Hulk Hogan, and a fist-pumping post-assassination attempt Trump.\nEven the appearance of more money and interest in defense tech could have a knock-on effect for startup founders hoping to chase what’s trendy. Dempsey said he expects investors and founder to “pattern-match to companies like Anduril and to a lesser extent SpaceX, believing that their outcomes will be the same.” The increased political and cultural friendliness toward weapons startups also coincides with high interest rates and growing interest in hardware companies, Dempsey explained, as software companies have lost their luster following years of growth driven by little more than cheap venture capital.\nThere’s every reason to believe a Trump-controlled Washington will give the tech industry, increasingly invested in militarized AI, what it wants. In July, the Washington Post reported the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute was working on a proposal to “Make America First in AI” by undoing regulatory burdens and encouraging military applications. Trump has already indicated he’ll reverse the Biden administration’s executive order on AI safety, which mandated safety testing and risk-based self-reporting by companies. Michael Kratsios, chief technology officer during the first Trump administration and managing director of Air Force contractor Scale AI, is reportedly advising Trump’s transition team on policy matters.\n“‘Make America First in AI’ means the United States will move quickly, regardless of the costs, to maintain its competitive edge over China,” Brianna Rosen, the Oxford fellow, explained. “That translates into greater investment and fewer restrictions on military AI. Industry already leads AI development and deployment in the defense and intelligence sectors; that role has now been cemented.”\nThe mutual embrace of MAGA conservatism and weapons tech seems to already be paying off. After dumping $200 million into the Trump campaign’s terminal phase, Musk was quick to cash his chips in: On Thursday, the New York Times reported that he petitioned Trump SpaceX executives into positions at the Department of Defense before the election had even begun. Musk will also co-lead a nebulous new office dedicated to slashing federal spending. Rep. Matt Gaetz, brother-in-law to Luckey, now stands to be the country’s next attorney general. In a post-election interview with Bloomberg, Luckey shared that he is already advising the Trump transition team and endorses the current candidates for defense secretary. “We did well under Trump, and we did better under Biden,” he said of Anduril. “I think we will do even better now.”\n",

    "text": "The cryptocurrency industry took a victory lap Wednesday. Devotees of digital currencies had cause to celebrate: An ally in Donald Trump had taken the White House and a slew of pro-crypto congressional candidates won races that included at least two Senate seats.\nOnly two years after the spectacular collapse of frauds like Sam Bankman-Fried ushered in a “crypto winter” in Washington, the industry wielded a $200 million campaign bankroll to buy itself back into D.C.’s good graces.\nCrypto-backed candidates were close to running the table in Senate races after the election of Republican Bernie Moreno in Ohio and Democrat Elissa Slotkin in Michigan. The election of Trump, who has promised to make America the world’s “crypto capital,” sent bitcoin prices soaring.\nOnly the undecided Arizona Senate race between Democrat Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake left in doubt a total sweep in top-level races for favorites of the digital currency industry. The crypto candidate in that race, Gallego, was ahead in the count as Arizona continued to process the ballot on Wednesday.\nThe near-total victory put members of Congress and potential candidates on notice that if you don’t take positions favored by the industry, crypto will come after you with millions, said Rick Claypool, research director at the progressive consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.\n“Now, the message that Congress receives,” Claypool said, “is very much that how you vote on crypto-related policy, those decisions are going to have consequences in terms of big crypto spending money for or against you.”\nCrypto skeptics like Claypool warned that the results of the spending could soon be felt and that ordinary Americans would need to hang onto their wallets.\n“In all likelihood, crypto deregulation is coming,” said Claypool. “People are going to have to be really careful about what they’re doing with their money. It looks like a tragedy waiting to happen.”\nThe results capped an extraordinary election that marked a new era for campaign finance with Citizens United, the 2011 Supreme Court decision, coming to full fruition.\nSince Citizens United, business interests have often funneled their money through “dark money” nonprofits. This year, however, the crypto industry was straightforward about its massive spending to boost supporters and blast opponents.\nThe industry raised more than $197 million and spent at least $133 million on federal races, according to campaign finance reports compiled by technology researcher and writer Molly White.\nThe money was split between Republican and Democratic candidates at the congressional level in the primaries, but heavy spending on Moreno in the race’s final weeks tipped the overall balance toward the GOP.\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown’s defeat was a stinging loss for consumer advocates who had long found a vocal leader in the Senate Banking Committee chair. Moreno was a car dealer with little statewide profile but an enthusiastic blockchain booster, when the industry adopted him as its candidate.\nBrian Armstrong, the CEO of leading cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, celebrated the industry’s wins on social media.\n“Welcome to the new members of America’s most pro-crypto Congress ever… 219+ pro-crypto candidates and counting have now been elected to the House & Senate. Tonight the crypto voter has spoken decisively – across party lines and in key races across the country,” he wrote Wednesday.\nYet many ordinary Americans probably never realized crypto was on the ballot. The tens of millions of dollars the leading industry lobbying group, the Fairshake PAC, spent on Moreno and other candidates never mentioned crypto, instead seizing on issues like inflation and immigration.\n“I don’t think it’s an endorsement by the voters of cryptocurrencies at all, because the millions they presented in ads to advance the crypto sector’s interest didn’t say a word about crypto,” Claypool said.\nCrypto already scored a major victory in the House of Representatives this year when it won bipartisan support for its top priority, a bill to shift oversight from the Securities and Exchange Commission to a regulator that is perceived as more industry-friendly, the understaffed Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nThe industry’s victories in Senate races give it clear momentum when the new Congress takes office in January.\nEven without immediate action in Congress, crypto could see its most aggressive regulator defanged. Trump could replace crypto foe Gary Gensler as the SEC chair, although he could not fire him from the commission outright.\nCrypto investor Cameron Winklevoss celebrated the impending changeover on X.\n“Imagine how much we are going to accomplish in the next 4 years,” he wrote, “now that the crypto industry won’t be hemorrhaging $ billions on legal fees fighting the SEC and instead investing this money into building the future of money. Amazing awaits.”\nEditor’s Note: In September 2022, The Intercept received $500,000 from Sam Bankman-Fried’s foundation, Building a Stronger Future, as part of a $4 million grant to fund our pandemic prevention and biosafety coverage.

    "author": "Grey Moran",
    "date": "2024-10-19T07:00:00-04:00",
    "text": "On a chilly, early morning in January 2019, a group of animal rights activists descended upon a poultry farm in central Texas. Donning plastic gloves, medical masks, hazmat suits, and T-shirts emblazoned with “Meat the Victims,” they slipped through the unlocked door of a massive, windowless barn.\nInside, they found 27,000 chicks densely packed across the floor, like “just a sea of yellow,” recalled Sarah Weldon, one of the activists. “There were a lot of chicks that were already deceased, in various stages of decomposition,” she said. “Some were so deformed you couldn’t even tell they used to be baby chicks, just fluffs of feathers.”\nActivists with Meat the Victims, a decentralized, global movement to abolish animal exploitation, later uploaded gruesome photos of injured and dead chicks to social media platforms. This is how, Weldon suspects, the police identified her and issued a warrant for her arrest, along with 14 other activists. She was charged with criminal trespassing, a Class B misdemeanor, and quickly turned herself into jail.\nThe local police weren’t the only ones paying attention. An FBI agent in Texas had been secretly monitoring the demonstration. His focus? Weapons of mass destruction.\nThe FBI has been collaborating with the meat industry to gather information on animal rights activism, including Meat the Victims, under its directive to counter weapons of mass destruction, or WMD, according to agency records recently obtained by the nonprofit Animal Partisan through Freedom of Information Act litigation. The records also show that the bureau has explored charging activists who break into factory farms under federal criminal statutes that carry a possible sentence of up to life in prison — including for the “attempted use” of WMD — while urging meat producers to report encounters with activists to its WMD program.\nAnimal rights lawyers and advocates view this new frontier for WMD allegations as a pretense, a fictive way to legitimize the criminal prosecution of animal rights activists.\nThe FBI declined to comment on these plans or clarify whether it is still actively considering charging activists under statutes for WMD.\n“This kind of escalation in charging or threats of charges is textbook escalation by government actors against successful efforts by social movements that they disagree with or find subversive,” said Justin Marceau, a law professor who runs a legal clinic for animal activists at the University of Denver. “The very framing of civil disobedience against factory farms as terrorism is a form of government repression.”\nThe bureau has floated the idea of charging animal rights activists under a statute prohibiting biological weapons, a subtype of WMD, the records show. This may include toxins, viruses, and microorganisms used to deliberately spur death and disease.\nMarceau described this focus on agroterrorism as an effort to pin blame on activists for the rampant disease outbreaks on factory farms.\n“It’s a transparent form of scapegoating and blame shifting” that avoids “talking about the disease risks that come from having animals intensively confined in these high stress conditions,” he said, referring to factory farms. “We know these are just petri dishes of disease and contamination.”\nThe new records — two FBI memos and a presentation — reveal a burgeoning relationship between the meat industry and the FBI’s WMD Directive, charged with countering the most serious biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear threats. Each of the FBI’s 56 field offices has a designated agent (a “weapons of mass destruction coordinator”) tasked with investigating suspected uses of WMD.\nBack in Texas in 2019, Holmes Foods, Texas’s largest privately owned chicken producer, tipped the feds off to Meat the Victims’ entry into a factory farm on January 26. The company purchases chickens from the poultry broiler the activists entered.\nJust a day after the action, the chicken producer contacted the Dallas FBI outpost for “guidance on preparing for future incidents,” the records show. The following morning, the local WMD coordinator got on the phone with company executives and other local FBI agents to gather information about the incident.\nHolmes Foods’ executives told the FBI that “no damage or product loss was immediately identified” in the poultry barn. Yet Dallas’s WMD program documented the incident as part of its intelligence gathering on “animal rights environmental extremism,” which the FBI considers a form of domestic terrorism. This was collected “for situational awareness purposes,” the records show — a phrase that some claim law enforcement agents use as a cover to surveil activists exercising First Amendment rights. “What they call situational awareness is Orwellian speak for watching and intimidation,” Baher Azmy, a legal director at the Center for Constitutional Rights, previously told The Intercept.\nHolmes Foods declined to comment.\nThis collaborative relationship between the FBI’s WMD outpost in Dallas and the meat industry continued into the following year.\nThe Meat Institute (formerly North American Meat Institute), the largest trade association for poultry and livestock industries in the United States, invited a federal agent to its 2020 Animal Care and Handling Conference to “provide insight into agroterrorism and federal law enforcement’s approach to protecting the United States meat industry,” the records show.\nAt the virtual conference, the agent for Dallas’s WMD program presented a slideshow, titled “Agroterrorism in the Meat/Livestock Industry,” before a crowd of over 80 attendees largely from the meat industry. The agent detailed the “emerging” WMD and domestic terrorism threats posed by animal rights activist groups — naming Meat the Victims as well as Direct Action Everywhere, or DxE — which often break minor criminal laws, such as prohibitions on trespassing, to bring attention to animal cruelty.\nThe agent warned that these “minor criminal actions associated with animal rights activist extremism have a tendency to escalate toward substantial direct actions, to include the unintentional introduction of biological materials, toxic chemicals or other hazards into a herd and/or flock,” the records note. The agent also encouraged industry groups to report this type of civil disobedience to its WMD Directive or Joint Terrorism Task Forces, displaying a map of all the FBI’s field offices.\nThe agent then gave a glimpse into the legal strategy the FBI has been exploring, including potential charges under three federal criminal statutes that cover biological forms of WMD. One statute defines a WMD as “any weapon involving a biological agent, toxin, or vector” and specifies that the damage inflicted by a WMD can conclude the “deterioration of food.” Another statute relies on the same definition for a WMD, but criminalizes sharing information about how to make or use these unconventional weapons.\nThe agent also noted that the Meat the Victims activists in Texas were “charged with misdemeanor criminal trespass,” but also “emphasized the potential [domestic terrorism] and WMD food sector connections,” suggesting that this is the type of activism the bureau might target with criminal charges.\nWill Lowrey, the legal counsel for Animal Partisan, noted the stark contrast between the FBI’s apparent willingness to protect the meat industry and its attitude toward those concerned with protecting animals. “The activists are in a different position when it comes to the government than the meat industry, which can reach out to the most powerful law enforcement agency in the country and say, ‘We want you to talk to us and help us figure out how to defend against these people,’” he said.\nThe FBI has tried to frame animal rights activists as biosecurity and infectious disease threats in at least one other known instance. In 2019, the FBI’s field office in San Francisco claimed that activists with DxE were breaking into poultry facilities and rescuing birds with “little to no regard for basic biosecurity measures” according to a memo first published by reporter Lee Fang. Citing a handful of journal articles, the FBI determined that this contributed to the spread of Newcastle disease, a highly contagious bird illness.\nZoe Rosenberg, an organizer with DxE, said that the group goes “above and beyond” the biosecurity protocols laid out by federal and state agencies. That includes wearing a biosecurity suit, gloves, hair net, and shoe covers while interacting with any farm animals. Upon exiting a facility, “all of that protective equipment is sealed and disposed of safely, just in case it is contaminated with any bacteria or virus from within the facility,” said Rosenberg.\nEven still, in Rosenberg’s ongoing prosecution for felony and misdemeanor charges stemming from an action last year, a local California prosecutor painted her as a bioterror threat.\nWeldon, of Meat the Victims, said the Texas poultry farm she entered didn’t lock its gate or barn door, so “they’re obviously not too concerned about biohazards,” she said.\nThe most serious risk, she added, would have likely remained hidden without the activists’ intervention. “Nobody is coming in there and cleaning up the dead bodies,” said Weldon, referring to the chicks. “If there’s disease, you know, disease is just going to spread rampant.”",

    "text": "The largest lamb slaughterhouse in the U.S. is in Denver — but maybe not for long.\nSuperior Farms processes between 15 and 20 percent of lambs killed for meat in the U.S. each year. Its vast Denver slaughterhouse, located for decades in the Globeville neighborhood — one of the poorest areas in the city, with over 90 percent Latino residents — advertises sustainable, locally sourced, halal-certified meat production and an employee-owned business model.\nNow, though, animal rights advocates are trying to upend that carefully constructed image by releasing new disturbing footage, obtained surreptitiously on the slaughterhouse floor.\nThe investigators behind the exposé hope it will aid efforts to pass a ballot measure in next month’s election that would shutter the facility. Organizers with the grassroots group Pro-Animal Future managed to get the measure, which would ban slaughterhouses within city and county limits, on the city ballot.\nAlong with pointing to checkered labor and environmental records that have led to over $200,000 in fines for violations in the last decade, animal rights advocates want the revelations about the conditions at the slaughterhouse to encourage votes for the ballot initiative.\nThe slaughterhouse footage, captured in July and August by secret cameras snuck into the facility by anonymous members of the Direct Action Everywhere, or DxE, network, was made public on Wednesday in a report by the Animal Activist Legal Defense Project, or AALDP, at the University of Denver.\nThe videos may show a range of animal abuses, routine cruelties, and instances that legal experts with the AALDP say could violate animal cruelty and humane slaughter laws. (The DxE investigators work anonymously to avoid tangles with law enforcement for entering the slaughterhouse and filming without Superior Farms’ permission.)\nVideos shared with The Intercept prior to the report’s public release show, among other scenes, lambs with their throats slit hanging upside down and thrashing on the slaughter line; one animal with an internal organ that has been torn inside-out and left dangling behind it as it heads to slaughter; injured lambs being led to slaughter; workers laughing, spanking animals, and engaging in simulated sex acts with nearby machinery as lambs are having their throats slit; and the apparent use of so-called Judas sheep — adult sheep kept alive at the facility and used to lead the young sheep to slaughter.\n“In general, that’s what you can expect to see in a slaughterhouse,” said Eric Davis, a retired veterinarian at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine, who reviewed a video reel provided by the animal rights activists. “This one is on the edge of badness, but it’s not going to be that much better if it’s running well.”If successful, the Denver ballot initiative, Ordinance 309, would end all these practices by prohibiting the construction or operation of slaughterhouses in the City and County of Denver.\nWhen reached for comment, a spokesperson for Superior Farms, Bob Mariano, questioned whether The Intercept had verified that the footage was from the Denver location on the dates claimed by DxE. The Intercept was able to verify the dates from the footage’s time stamp. The Animal Activist Legal Defense Project attested to the veracity of the location, and footage taken by the investigators outside the facility aligns with images on Google Maps. The Intercept shared still frames from the obtained footage with Superior Farms and asked the company to confirm whether it showed their Denver facility. At the time of publication, the company had declined to identify the facility.\n“Every workday, over 1,000 baby sheep have their throats slit at Superior Farms,” one of the investigators from DxE, who did not give their name, said by email. “This election cycle, Denver has a rare opportunity to put an end to this practice on an industrial scale within our city.”\nThe Superior Farms slaughterhouse is the only one currently operating in Denver’s city limits, so would be the only plant affected by Ordinance 309’s passing. The decision could, however, have lasting and profound effects on the animal agriculture industry nationwide.\nKenny Rogers, a past president of the Colorado Livestock Association, which has teamed up with Superior and others to opposing the ballot measure, told Denver’s Westword weekly paper, “Essentially, that’s the jugular vein of the sheep industry here in the state.”\nThe Superior Farms spokesperson said the company opposed the ballot measure in a bid to save its employees’ livelihoods.\n“The slaughterhouse ban on the ballot in Denver this November (Initiated Ordinance 309) unfairly targets a single employee-owned business and forces 160 employees out of a company they own,” said Mariano. “Banning a single Denver business won’t improve animal welfare, but it will have devastating consequences for our employee-owners and their families.”\nAccording to a memo from the AALDP, the video clips showing lambs that appear to raise their heads and thrash could be evidence that the animals are not fully unconscious.\nDavis, the former UC-Davis veterinarian and former associate veterinarian with the school’s International Animal Welfare Training Institute, said it was difficult to ascertain from the video whether the animals are stunned prior to slaughter. Either way, he said, the thrashing from lambs after having their throats slit does not necessarily indicate consciousness — something that would violate standards for humane slaughter.\n“I would expect fewer of them moving than are,” he said. “The fact that they’re moving does not allow me to prove that they’re conscious.”\nIn one case, where a lamb that appeared to have its throat cut lifted its head and opened its mouth, Davis said there were concerns about consciousness.\n“That animal looks like it’s vocalizing,” Davis said. “Whatever was done to kill that animal, that animal is still alive, and probably conscious or partially so.”\nGuidelines produced by humane livestock treatment expert Temple Grandin for the American Meat Institute — whose successor group, the Meat Institute, is the largest donor to the campaign against the Denver initiative — say that the head and neck of a stunned animal can indicate insensibility.\n“The legs may kick, but the head and neck must be loose and floppy like a rag,” Grandin — whom Mariano, the Superior Farms spokesperson, said consulted on upgrades at the Denver facility — writes in the guidelines. “A normal spasm may cause some neck flexing, generally to the side, but the neck should relax and the head should flop within about 20 seconds.”\nIn another clip, a lamb with a leg injury is seen being moved in a plastic sled and shoved into the slaughter line by workers. It then hobbles up the ramp to slaughter. Davis called the practices into question.\n“If you get down to the way the sheep are handled, particularly with the fractured leg,” he said. “The personnel there are certainly rough with them, perhaps more so than they need to be.”\nAnimal rights advocates are hoping the facilities closure will set a precedent for other ballot measures around the country, while, owing to the scale of the Denver facility, also directly causing a dent in the animal agribusiness.\nThe ballot initiative found predictable opposition in the powerful animal agriculture industry. A committee opposing the measure has raised over $1 million from dozens of donors, including the American Sheep Industry Association, the National Pork Producers Council, and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. Superior Farms, headquartered in California, has donated over $160,000.\nTheir message — the committee is called “Stop the Ban Protect Jobs” — has apparently found an audience. Local politicians and community members worried about job loss from the slaughterhouse’s potential closure have raised concerns that cannot be dismissed as mere vested business interests. If passed, the ban would see the loss of around 160 Superior Farms jobs as part of a 14-month closure schedule mandated by the measure.\nOne Colorado State University study claims there could be an overall loss of up to 2,700 jobs, after accounting for multiplier effects on the broader industry. The study authors acknowledged that their “working relationships with livestock producers, farmers, ranchers, and meat processors are significant, longstanding and valued” in their report’s preface, but added “we believe the conclusions of our analysis are independent, data-based and speak for themselves.” The study, however, has come in for criticism from animal rights advocates at Pro-Animal Future not only for industry ties, but also for its substance.\nMeanwhile, the ballot measure itself acknowledges and seeks to counteract the potential job loss. Specific wording requires the city to prioritize residents whose employment is affected for workforce training or employment assistance programs, in part by drawing on the city’s $40 million Climate Protection Fund.\nMariano, the company spokesperson, questioned whether alternative forms of employment will work out. “What we know for sure is that 160 hard-working people will lose their jobs and the benefits their families rely on if the ban passes, and there are no guarantees at all, despite the claims of proponents, that these workers will be able to access any kind of program to help them get another job,” he said. “These workers like their jobs and have employee-ownership.”\nIn an agriculture trade publication, Council Member Darrell Watson, who represents Denver’s District 9 where Superior Farms is located, accused the ballot measure and its worker-related provision of “cynicism” for placing the burden of the plant’s 160 employees on the city.\nYet proponents of the measure say there is cynicism, too, in suggesting that industrialized meat production, with all its attendant harms, cannot be stopped because slaughterhouse jobs need to be preserved.\n“Our vision isn’t about eliminating jobs; it’s about moving in the direction of better ones,” a spokesperson from Pro-Animal Future said by email. “Just as we transitioned from whale oil to electricity or from coal to renewable energy, we’re now recognizing the harms of industrial animal farming, and the need to evolve in a new direction. This type of transition never happens in isolation, but rather in the context of our broader economy where we also see a constant emergence of innovative sectors and new job opportunities.”\nThough opponents of Ordinance 309 have made the job losses a centerpiece of their campaign, the ballot measure’s proponents say it is not so clear that slaughterhouse jobs make for an ethical, community-minded workplace. Slaughter plant workers nationwide experience disproportionately high rates of serious mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder. The jobs are also physically dangerous, with American slaughterhouse workers seeing an average of two amputations per week.\nSuperior Farms’ Denver facility itself has seen a handful of allegations about labor abuses. In the last decade, the plant has been fined $91,811, much of it an accumulation of small wage violations; some related to safety issues like missing stair railings; and one fine related to a failure to include hazardous chemicals in a regulatory form.\nThere have also been other complaints. A Muslim employee at Superior Farms sued the company in 2021 alleging racial and religious discrimination after Black Muslim workers were, according to the suit, subject to racial slurs from co-workers and managers, and faced termination for refusing to fraudulently certify meat as halal. The former employee settled with the company on undisclosed terms in 2022. (“We strongly deny these allegations, and this case was settled and dismissed two years ago,” said Mariano, the Superior Farms spokesperson.)\nNonetheless, some Superior Farms employees are rallying to defend the plant and the industry.\n“Superior Farms has opened doors not just for me, but for so many,” said Isabel Bautista, operations manager at the slaughterhouse, at a recent rally opposing the ballot measure. For Bautista, who has worked at the facility since 2000, the business is a family affair: her mother, brother, brother-in-law, and cousins have worked there at various points too.\n“This job means financial security to me and my family,” Bautista told a trade publication, “but it’s also a job I love.”\n“One in six of our staff have been with Superior for over ten years, and one in four have been here for more than five years,” said Mariano. “People who apply to work at the facility get the full tour so they can understand exactly what these jobs entail and see if they are comfortable doing this kind of work. The meat industry is not unique in facing challenges related to turnover.”\nOrdinance 309 supporters face an uphill battle. Their opponents describe the ballot measure as an attack on local jobs, waged by outside special interest groups with dark money — allegations Pro-Animal Future reject as industry propaganda. The Denver Democratic Party announced its opposition to the initiative in late September. And several key unions like the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 have come out against 309 too.\nIt would be a familiar pattern. Immediate economic concerns tend to win out over the promise of a better future with sacrifices today. The impulse is understandable, especially in the absence of sufficient municipal, state, and federal infrastructure and support for the swift transition of every imperiled worker into more sustainable jobs.\nFor the animal rights activists, though, failure to pass the Ordinance 309 would perpetuate cruel practices and unsustainable meat production. One of the undercover investigators, a Denver-based activist with DxE who gave their first name but requested anonymity to avoid law enforcement, told me that there are possible legal routes to explore relating to animal cruelty law violations exposed in their footage. Failing to ensure that animals are fully unconscious on a slaughter line, for example, is a violation of humane slaughter and animal cruelty laws.\nThe animal rights advocates, however, are less concerned with the potential violations of rules of the state or religions than they are with the suffering of the animals, captured in hours and hours of footage. And they hope the same suffering moves public opinion to support the facility’s shuttering.\n“Every time the realities of factory farming and slaughterhouses are exposed, people are shocked and horrified by what is happening,” said Chris Carraway, staff attorney at the Animal Activist Legal Defense Project, which represents the undercover investigators. “Then, the news cycle moves on. But the horrors continue. It is clear there is no way to make slitting throats humane. We need to do more than expose these practices — we need to start putting an end to them, once and for all.”\nThe undercover investigator interviewed by The Intercept described themself as “an optimist” about people’s ability to empathize with the animals in their videos.\n“I have that fundamental faith that Americans and human beings will be able to see cruelty and understand it as cruelty,” they said. “But I think that people changing their actual behaviors in life, and the reasons why they are slow or resist doing so, is much more complicated.”\n",

    "text": "In the early morning hours last Friday, Nick climbed out of his bunk at Mountain View Correctional Institution in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, and stepped into a pool of water.\nAs Hurricane Helene unleashed a torrential downpour over Western North Carolina, Nick, whose story was relayed by a relative and who requested to go by his first name for fear of retribution, realized his single-occupancy cell in the state prison had begun to flood. Then he realized that his toilet no longer flushed.\nFor the next five days, more than 550 men incarcerated at Mountain View suffered in cells without lights or running water, according to conversations with the family members of four men serving sentences at the facility, as well as one currently incarcerated man. Until they were transferred to different facilities, the prisoners lost all contact with the outside world.\nAs nearby residents sought refuge from the storm, the men were stuck in prison — by definition, without the freedom to leave — in close quarters with their own excrement for nearly a week from September 27 until October 2.\n“My husband told me this morning he’s going to have to go see a therapist because of the things that happened in there,” Bridget Gentry told The Intercept. “He said, ‘We thought we were going to die there. We didn’t think anybody was going to come back for us.’”\nFamily members told The Intercept that their loved ones were forced to defecate in plastic bags after their toilets filled up with feces, stowing the bags in their cells until the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction finally evacuated the facility on Wednesday evening.\n“There were some minor roof leaks during the storm, but no flooding. The buildings held up extremely well during the storm. Water and electrical utilities that serve the prisons and the communities around them were severely damaged,” said Keith Acree, the head of communications at NCDAC. “When it became apparent that power and water outages would be long-term, we made the decisions to relocate offenders.”\nAcree said the generator at Mountain View provided electric power to “essential systems”: “Every single light fixture and outlet is not powered, but there is some lighting and power in every area.”\nHe confirmed that incarcerated people went to the bathroom in plastic bags. “Some offenders did defecate in plastic bags,” he said. “That was a solution they devised on their own.”\nLoved ones of men incarcerated at Mountain View claimed food rations were scarce, amounting to four crackers for breakfast, a cup of juice or milk, and two pieces of bread with peanut butter for lunch and dinner. Potable drinking water did not arrive for several days. (“The facilities did not run out of food or water,” said Acree, adding that three meals a day were provided along with bottled water and buckets for flushing toilets.)\nOn October 3, the NCDAC announced it had evacuated a total of more than 2,000 incarcerated people from five facilities in flood-ravaged Western North Carolina, relocating them further east. “All offenders are safe,” stated the press release.\n“We had to stay in a six by nine foot cell with feces in the toilet and the room smelling bad,” said Sammy Harmon Jr., a man incarcerated at Mountain View. He told The Intercept he began to develop sores on his legs due to lack of sanitation.\n“I wasn’t doing too good,” he said, “going a week without a shower or water to use the toilet.”\nFamily members of the men at Mountain View detailed a slow, confusing, and inequitable response to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene.\nThe NCDAC’s website says it began to relocate people from a minimum-security women’s prison in Swannanoa and a women’s substance abuse treatment center in Black Mountain on September 30.\nMeanwhile, just half a mile down the road from Mountain View, more than 800 men at Avery-Mitchell Correctional Institution also faced flooding and water outages. They were relocated on October 1, a day before Mountain View. (Craggy Correctional Institution in Asheville was evacuated on October 2, after days of silence from the NCDAC, but did not suffer as dire conditions as the other prisons, according to family members of people incarcerated there.)\n“Facilities were prioritized for transfer based on the level of storm impacts to each facility and the information we had about expected restoration of water and power,” said Acree, the state prison system spokesperson. “Avery Mitchell was prioritized above Mountain View due to the nature of its housing areas” — dormitory versus single-cell housing, respectively. “Staff felt that maintaining safety and security in a single cell environment could be maintained effectively for longer than in the open dorms.”\nWendy Floyd, whose fiancé is incarcerated at Avery-Mitchell, said the men lacked drinking water until a delivery arrived by helicopter on Sunday night. The water rations were paltry, Floyd said: “It was basically decide whether you want to drink the water or if you want to wash yourself.”\nAvery-Mitchell’s generator kept the power on, but Floyd said that in the absence of running water, the men were also forced to defecate in plastic bags.\n“The conditions that residents in Western North Carolina are currently coping with are much more dire than what offenders in the two Spruce Pine prisons experienced,” Acree wrote. “The populations of the two Spruce Pine prisons are extremely fortunate to now be relocated and safe. That’s so much more than many others in western NC have right now.”\nSpruce Pine, where Mountain View and Avery-Mitchell are located, is one of the many small Appalachian towns decimated by flooding from Hurricane Helene. The most deadly hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina, Helene’s death toll has surpassed 200 and is expected to climb in coming weeks, as rescue crews strive to locate hundreds of missing people.\nIn the wake of the devastation, dozens of major news reports have highlighted how the flooding of Spruce Pine could impact its quartz mines and disrupt the global microchip industry — but the town’s incarcerated population has gone entirely overlooked.\nFamily members described nearly a week of a harrowing communications blackout, as they scoured online groups, emailed the governor, and repeatedly called officials to determine whether their loved ones had survived the hurricane and its aftermath. The NCDAC began posting general updates on its website on September 29, though family members felt the communications were insufficient and vague.\nStephanie Luffman said she began leaving comments on NCDAC’s Facebook page, begging for an update on her partner’s whereabouts.\n“I feel like the NCDAC wasn’t going to do anything until I started raising hell,” she said. She considered paying someone in the area to take drone photos of Mountain View, just so she could know if it was still standing.\n“I tried calling everyone in the world,” said Melanie Walters, whose 26-year-old son is incarcerated at Mountain View. Walters said that when she finally managed to reach the voicemail of NCDAC Secretary Todd Ishee, it instructed callers to only leave messages regarding emergencies, not inquiries about missing prisoners.\n“How dare he — it is an emergency when I don’t know where my son is for a week,” Walters said. She eventually learned from Facebook that somebody in the area had seen buses leaving the prison and figured, “Oh thank God, it’s got to be my son.”\nLoved ones of the incarcerated also noted their frustration surged when they saw NCDAC’s announcement that Avery-Mitchell had been evacuated first, without any updates addressing the status of Mountain View.\n“Avery-Mitchell, you could literally throw a rock and hit it from Mountain View, they’re on the same street,” said Gentry.\nWhile Mountain View and Avery-Mitchell are both medium-security facilities, Mountain View requires prisoners to stay locked in single cells for up to 23 hours a day; Avery-Mitchell is dormitory-style.\n“I just think they didn’t want to deal with the prisoners at Mountain View who were considered higher security risk,” said Luffman.\nIn interviews with The Intercept, sources described several instances of prison guards at Mountain View retaliating against incarcerated people in the aftermath of the storm, including pepper spraying them for yelling and beating an older man for accumulating too many bags of feces.\n“Mom, it was so bad,” Walters recalled her son telling her. “I can’t even tell you everything that happened. It was just so bad. I never want to go back there again.”\nOn September 25, one day before Hurricane Helene made landfall, the NCDAC announced that a man incarcerated at Mountain View had died of an apparent suicide. He had already served seven years and was scheduled for release in January 2028.\n“Inside there, you’re a number. You do not matter. You are treated worse than a rabid dog,” said Gentry. “What happened to him in there to make him think there was no other way? I fear that for my husband every day — that he’s just going to give up on coming home.”",

    "text": "In partnership with\nAll Sheila Mae Dobbins wants is an apology.\nIn 2014, an industrial facility producing wood pellets opened so close to her house in Gloster, Mississippi, that she could overhear conversations between managers and staffers as they worked and smell the fumes the plant pumped into the air.\nDobbins, a 59-year-old mother of two, relies on an oxygen tank to breathe, as do her sister and her brother-in-law, who also live in the town. Her husband Neal depended on an oxygen tank as well, but passed away in 2017, just as Dobbins was experiencing an acute health crisis that led to her diagnosis with heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. She tears up when discussing how her own hospitalization left her unable to care for her husband of 36 years before he died.\n“I was on life support,” said Dobbins, who wore a tracheotomy tube with a speaking valve. “I couldn’t walk, couldn’t talk. And through all this, my husband was sick and I didn’t even know it.”\nThe company that owns the plant, the U.K.-based power giant Drax Group, originally claimed that the pellet mill would bring hundreds of millions of dollars of investments to the local economy and touted the possibility of growing renewable power within the state.\nInstead, the plant employs only a handful of local workers, and its wood pellets are shipped abroad to be burned for electricity in Drax’s U.K. power station and other foreign power plants. Residents of Gloster, a small town 50 miles north of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, claim that the mill has polluted their air and harmed their health. In 2020, the Mississippi mill was fined $2.5 million for exceeding the legal limits of harmful air pollutants, and Drax promised to install new pollution controls. It has since continued to breach emission limits and this month faced another six-figure penalty.\nGloster is just one of seven pellet mills that Drax operates in the U.S., along with 10 in Canada, and the company is currently at work on new projects in Washington state and California. Land and Climate Review’s previous investigation into Drax’s Canadian mills uncovered 189 violations of environmental law, most of which related to air pollution. Drax’s two pellet mills in Louisiana have been fined millions for environmental law violations, and one entered dispute resolution discussions in March over further emissions breaches.\nThis sprawling operation is built to pursue a noble goal: replacing the coal-fired electricity generation at the U.K.’s largest single power plant, the Drax facility in the north of England, with a renewable input in the form of wood pellets.\nBut a growing chorus of environmentalists and scientists are warning that the U.K. power plant is now more carbon-intensive burning wood than when the plant burned coal. The entire company, from power plant to pellet mills, is only profitable thanks to massive subsidies from the U.K. government — yet the company plans to open multiple new power plants in the U.S. in the coming years and is seeking federal subsidies to build its new projects.\nThe residents of Gloster, and other towns across the U.S. near Drax’s current and future facilities, are asking a simple question: Why is a company propped up by the British government for an unclear environmental gain polluting their air?\nDrax denies any physical impact on Gloster residents, saying “an independent, third-party analysis commissioned by Drax found that our Gloster facility’s air toxics have no adverse effects on human health.” Questions remain, however, as Drax declined to provide the name of the consulting firm or any more details on their findings.\nAnother Gloster resident, Myrtis Woodard, has firsthand experience of the problem. “It was better before that mill came,” Woodard said. “We can’t come outside, the air is so bad. I’ve got two inhalers and the doctor tried to give me another one. I have asthma, COPD, and angina.”\nDebra Butler, another Gloster resident, echoed Woodard. “My yard looks a mess,” she said. “I’m afraid to go outside because of my breathing problems. I was taking Albuterol once a day; now I take it three times a day in my inhaler. I come outside with a mask on. The air is so polluted you can smell everything, taste it.”\nOther friends and family members shared similar stories of heart and respiratory conditions emerging in the years since the plant opened. Dobbins knew six people who were reliant on oxygen tanks living on her street before she moved away. Five of them are now dead.\nThe emissions from Drax’s pellet mill are not the only possible drivers of the heart conditions or breathing problems that Gloster residents described, and no direct link between the plant and the residents’ health has been established. Gloster has an overall poverty rate of 39 percent; the state of Mississippi ranks second to last in the U.S. for overall health and last for childhood respiratory disease.\nLocals had hoped Drax could help revitalize the town’s economy. Instead, they described a town in decline.\n“In my opinion, everything has gone down,” said Krystal Martin, who is leading community action for cleaner air. “Gloster is small, extremely rural, it has no public schools. The houses are in poor conditions, the buildings are old and dilapidated.”\n“The grass don’t grow green like it used to,” she added. “The trees don’t bloom like they used to.”\nMartin started organizing with community members under the banner “Greater Greener Gloster” in 2021, inspired by her mother Jane’s breathing difficulties.\n“In 2016, I began to get sick, but I did not realize what was going on,” said Jane Martin. “In 2021, when the fine came out, we began to wonder if the air pollution had made me sick” over the years the plant had been operating.\nGreater Greener Gloster has galvanized opposition to the mill in the town. Despite her dependence on “a 37-foot cord” for oxygen, Dobbins is determined to speak out on the health impacts of the mill “as long as there’s breath in my body.”\n“I died three times, but God was not ready for me,” she said. “I am a walking testimony.”\nA research team at Brown University, led by Erica Walker, has found that the air in Gloster contains dramatically higher levels of toxic chemicals compared to a nearby town — and that levels of pollutants spike in the middle of the night.\nThe study, which is currently undergoing peer review, compares Gloster with a demographically similar town in Mississippi, Mendenhall, which does not have a wood pellet mill. Walker stressed the need for larger sample sizes and more time to monitor trends, but her initial findings are that “air pollutant concentrations in Gloster are magnitudes higher, even after adjusting for meteorological conditions.” This is especially true for a category of pollutants known as volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, which can be released when drying or burning wood.\n“VOCs are nasty stuff,” said Walker. “When you’re thinking about a child that’s exposed to that in utero, if it’s during a critical window, then we’re already talking about a compromised child from the beginning — and then it’s going to snowball over a period of time. VOCs have been shown to lead to short-term things like irritation to long-term things like cancer.”\nHeat maps in the study show concentrated clouds of pollutants around the plant and a nearby residential area. A preprint of the research states that vulnerable populations are impacted by air pollution from wood pellet plants, and that proximity is a statistically significant factor for risk of respiratory disease in children.\n“From the data that we got from Gloster in particular, we know that it’s an issue when people live next to these plants,” said Walker. “This is their short-term and long-term health profile. It has direct impacts.”\nA Drax spokesperson said the company’s consultants “found that no pollutant from the facility exceeded the acceptable ambient concentration.”\nAn unexpected finding in Walker’s research is what she calls “opportunistic dumping.” Her data shows what she describes as “crazy spikes” of VOC emissions throughout the night. She said that although the daily averages of VOCs seen by the Environmental Protection Agency do not look dangerous, her data reveals a “structural issue” in regulatory monitoring being conducted on a daily basis, rather than hourly.\nResidents remembered being more aware of pollution at night. Dobbins said, “At night sometimes I can’t rest, and I would have to get my husband up because I would like to sit outside. But when I went out there, I told him, ‘I’m going back in the house.’ The odor is just that bad.”\n“And the smell of it, I didn’t know it. In my life, I smelled nothing like it, so I couldn’t really describe it. But it’s a funky scent. A foul, very foul odor,” Dobbins continued. “We can smell it the most at night. It’s like they didn’t want nobody to see them do it.”\nEnvironmental attorney Patrick Anderson warned that it is possible the spikes are simply due to atmospheric conditions. “It could be that even if they’re emitting at a constant rate, when things cool down at night, the VOCs settle down into the community,” he said.\nBut he also suggested another possibility. “These facilities can bypass their emission controls. Sometimes there are reasons they absolutely need to do that to avoid something blowing up and people getting hurt.”\nWhile working for the Environmental Integrity Project, Anderson went into litigation with another wood pellet company in Texas and “really got to examine their operating records.” He found that they were bypassing their emission controls multiple times a week, inundating the local community with smoke each time.\n“They were not just doing it for emergencies — it was happening all of the time,” Anderson said. As with the findings in Gloster, “things were worse at night.”\nIn 2020, Louisiana state environmental regulators received a report from an anonymous source alleging that Drax facilities in that state had “literally hundreds of hours of uncontrolled venting annually.”\nThe Gloster mill’s own reporting to the regulator shows that pollution controls were bypassed for over 500 hours in 2023 — although there is no indication that the mill breached regulations by doing so. Responding to a letter from campaigners this April, the company promised to start “curtailing operations at night.”\nSince the start of 2024, the Gloster mill has been issued two letters outlining violations, including failure to provide inspectors with records and missing a deadline to conduct emissions testing by 43 days. But these are far from the company’s most egregious recent violations of environmental rules in the U.S.\nIn January, Louisiana regulators sent Drax a notice stating that the company had bypassed pollution controls on 381 instances between January 2022 and June 2023 at its two mills in the state. As a result, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality is currently negotiating a fine with Drax. That agency issued a similar notice in 2022 for prior violations, and Drax agreed to settle for $1.6 million per mill.\nThe company is also under scrutiny for emitting unsafe levels of a category of pollutants that Anderson, the environmental lawyer, describes as “some of the most toxic and harmful pollutants that are addressed by the Clean Air Act.” Hazardous air pollutants emitted by wood pellet mills include carcinogenic substances such as formaldehyde and benzene, as well as acrolein, which “causes lung and throat, nose and eye irritation, even in very, very low quantities.”\nIn 2021, the Mississippi government began to mandate tests for these “hazardous air pollutants” at the Gloster mill. The testing revealed that the facility had exceeded limits for these chemicals in both 2022 and 2023. Limits for specific chemicals were also breached throughout the period: The limit on methanol was exceeded by over 80 percent between June 2021 and June 2022, for example. In September 2024, Drax was fined $225,000 for these breaches, among other violations.\nIn 2023, Anderson and his colleague wrote to Louisiana regulators about Drax’s plants in the state, saying, “Drax is once again failing to accurately document and report its emissions.” The Environmental Integrity Project attorneys argued that after the new emissions testing had taken place in Gloster in 2021, “Drax could have — and should have — reported to [Louisiana’s Department for Environmental Quality] that its Louisiana plants were almost certainly exceeding permit limits. …  Instead, however, Drax continued to certify that its outdated and inaccurate [hazardous air pollutants] emissions data were accurate.”\nDrax later conceded that the Louisiana mills were indeed breaching limits, by 59 percent at its LaSalle plant in Urania, and by 58 percent at its Morehouse mill in Bastrop.\nDrax said that following the new emissions testing, it worked with the state’s Department for Environmental Quality to align on testing and permit updates.\nThe Gloster mill has now negotiated a hazardous air pollutant penalty with the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, but in Louisiana, similar enforcement action has not yet been taken. Anderson said such action is “plainly warranted.”\nAuthorities had been warned of suspect activity at Drax’s Louisiana mills before. In 2020, the state’s environmental department received an email from an anonymous source who claimed to work for the company.\nThe email made numerous allegations about Drax’s regulatory compliance, several of which inspectors subsequently confirmed: Waste was being handled improperly at the Morehouse mill, and being burned without a permit at LaSalle. Drax told Land and Climate Review that its history of burning industrial sludge “was an administrative error.”\nThe inspectors were unable to find evidence of some of the email’s most shocking claims, including that Drax had failed to report “literally hundreds of hours of uncontrolled venting” of harmful pollutants at each facility. “Many of these events would easily exceed the Reportable Quantity for Acrolein,” the email stated. Drax told Land and Climate Review that the acrolein claim was “unproven,” but did not comment on uncontrolled venting.\nThe email also included allegations that “no actions were taken” after management was told that pollution data was being manipulated, and that any mention of unreported pollution would “cause senior management to threaten termination.” Inspectors did not address claims about management behavior, and Drax denied the allegations, saying “our pattern and practice is to cooperate with local agencies charged with overseeing emissions.”\nEnvironmentalists and scientists warn that the pellet business is driving forest degradation, and that CO2 emissions from the U.K. power plant are actually more carbon-intensive than when it burned coal instead of wood. Drax, however, claims its pellet business is preventing forest fires and creating jobs, and that the pellets come from well managed forests, saying, “CO2 from the biogenic carbon cycle should be considered differently to the fossil CO2 released by the combustion of oil, gas, and coal.\n“Whether the wood is used for bioenergy, or these trees naturally decompose, the same amount of CO2 is released into the atmosphere.”\nDrax’s logic aligns with carbon accounting rules established in 1997, in a United Nations treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol. The treaty came into force in 2005 and significantly expanded the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. But buried within its pages, a relatively minor rule designed to prevent double-counting of emissions in different locations transformed the bioenergy industry.\nThe framework stated that emissions should be counted only in the country where trees are harvested, rather than in the place where they are burned. This effectively provided a carbon accounting loophole for countries that import wood to burn in power stations. In the U.K.’s case, even though Drax’s power station is the largest single source of CO2 in the country, its emissions are officially recorded as zero.\nThese rules are much criticized — even by some of the scientists who invented them — but still form the basis of U.K. policy. In 2021, 500 scientists wrote to the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, calling for the end of wood burning for energy.\n“The burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries. That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil or natural gas,” they wrote.\n“To avoid these harms, governments must end subsidies and other incentives that today exist for the burning of wood whether from their forests or others. The European Union needs to stop treating the burning of biomass as carbon neutral in its renewable energy standards and in its emissions trading system.”\nThis mounting concern from experts has spilled over into U.K. politics, with parliamentarians becoming increasingly vocal about Drax’s heavily subsidized wood pellet business and the CO2 emissions from its U.K. power plant.\nPoliticians from all mainstream U.K. political parties have spoken critically about publicly funding Drax’s supply chain. Even two recent U.K. energy secretaries are skeptics: Kwasi Kwarteng, who was secretary from 2021 to 2022, was recorded admitting that Drax’s supply chain “is not sustainable” and “doesn’t make any sense,” while his successor Jacob Rees-Mogg went further, publicly describing Drax’s “ridiculous” carbon accounting as “barmy in-Wonderland stuff.”\nSince the center-left Labour Party won the general election in July this year, both the U.K.’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, and Energy Minister, Ed Miliband, have been suspiciously quiet on the matter, not mentioning biomass in key speeches about the energy sector.\nDrax’s subsidies are set to run out in 2027, and deciding whether they should continue is a tricky issue for the U.K.’s new government. Renewal is likely to face backlash from Parliament, news media, and scientists. But Labour has set ambitious targets for clean energy, and politicians are already facing complaints from their constituents about new wind and solar farms. Meeting 2030 targets on paper, even if the scientific reality is more complicated, still offers political expediency that cleaner alternatives lack.\nDrax has been clear that its backup plan is to expand operations in the U.S. and seek security in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits and state-level incentives, rather than relying on U.K. subsidies. In early 2023, Drax’s CEO Will Gardiner told the press that the company would “accelerate” its U.S. plans and make the U.K. “less of a priority” if they had not gotten guarantees on future subsidies by July 2024. Drax also told Land and Climate Review that it intends to create new bioenergy carbon capture and storage facilities and to concentrate on carbon removal technology.\nThe U.K. guarantees have not arrived, and if the three new U.S. pellet mills in development are anything to go by, Drax may be serious about U.S. expansion.\nSince 2022, Drax Group has had its sights fixed on a new pellet mill, this time in the small northwestern city of Longview, nestled on the Columbia River in Washington state, some 50 miles north of Portland, Oregon.\nA high-gloss webpage for the $250 million project says that the plant will use sawdust and shavings from local sawmills to make their pellets and support more than 300 jobs in the area. “We’re Nature Positive,” the promotional page reads, “and our work centers on conserving the environment in which people across Washington and Oregon live, work, and play.”\nBut positivity — nature or otherwise — has not been the primary local sentiment in response to the project.\n“People are extremely concerned about this because they know what communities are going through in the Southeast with the wood pellet industry, and they just don’t want those problems,” explained Ashley Bennett, an environmental attorney at Earthjustice.\nDrax’s approach to the regulatory processes around the proposed mill has not alleviated these concerns. In its initial air permit application, Drax grossly underestimated the prospective emissions from the site, claiming the mill would emit just 0.53 tons per year of hazardous air pollutants. In subsequent correspondence with local pollution regulators, Drax revised this estimate to 48.9 tons per year.\nDrax underestimating their emissions in official filings by a factor of almost 100 shocked experts. According to Anderson, the initial estimates were “absolutely not plausible. They were using emission factors and emissions estimates that didn’t apply to wood pellet plants. It’s mind-boggling that this could happen, that they would be off by two orders of magnitude.”\nGiven its intended size and the toxicity of its emissions, the plant should be subject to the EPA’s Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or MACT, standard in order to minimize levels of hazardous air pollutants.\nBut in both its initial air permit application and subsequent correspondence with regulators, Drax failed to state that the Longview pellet mill would be a major source of hazardous air pollutants, and so subject to MACT standards.\nAnderson described this omission as “deeply, deeply concerning.” In its response, Drax said that it does not mislead on emissions and that its practice and policy is to cooperate with local agencies. In response to questions, Drax did not provide an explanation for how they had so drastically underestimated their emissions in their proposal, but denied that it was intended to mislead regulators.\nForty-year Longview resident Diane Dick said, “There is a concern about Drax” from locals, including in regard to “the community’s health, environmental health, and the health of forest resources.”\nDick called state regulators herself in March after she awoke one day to find that a large white dome had been installed overnight, at the industrial site below her house.\nHer call led to an investigation, followed by a clear finding by the local air agency that Drax had not only begun construction without legal authorization, but they were also installing equipment that was not included in the permit application or draft air permit. Dick’s dome sighting kicked off a chain of events that landed Drax with a $34,000 fine — and this was not even Drax’s first violation on the site. Late in 2023, the company also twice breached rules around water quality in the Columbia River.\nFollowing the investigation, Drax was instructed to stop construction, and the permitting process was halted.\nDrax’s initial claim that the mill’s raw material would be sourced from sawdust and shavings, rather than freshly logged timber — repeated both on the project website and its initial environmental impact report — has also fallen apart.\nIn the year since the initial environmental checklist was submitted, it has emerged that the project will require logging. Drax’s Director of Environment Wayne Kooy admitted as much in emails to regulators this year, saying it was an “oversight” that the original proposal stated the mill would only use “residual” wood. Drax’s website still says an “independent third-party consultant” confirmed that “surplus of residual sawdust and shavings is available within a 60-mile radius.”\nBased on the initial proposal, Cowlitz County awarded the project a determination of nonsignificance status, meaning that it would not have to undergo a more rigorous environmental impact assessment. Cowlitz County officials have since acknowledged, in public records obtained by Earthjustice, that Drax’s new plans to use commercial wood rather than waste would place the project “way outside of” the original proposition.\n“Drax seems to chronically and consistently underrepresent what its impact is going to be,” said Brenna Bell, forest climate manager at the environmental justice organization 350PDX. “I don’t think they’re making themselves very welcome.”\nWhen asked about these concerns, a Drax spokesperson said that the company works closely with regulators to establish best environmental practices, invested $180 million on improving the plants, and donated to local communities. She denied that Drax persistently misleads regarding pollution and environmental impacts.\nAs progress stalls in Washington, Drax is eyeing other developments 1000 miles down the West Coast.\nIn February, Drax signed onto a self-described “forest resiliency initiative,” intended to mitigate wildfire risk, that proposes to build two pellet mills in rural portions of California, one in Tuolumne County east of Modesto and another in Lassen County in the state’s far northeast.\nThe plan was put together by the Rural County Representatives of California, an association of local governments in rural parts of the state, and developed via a newly created public agency called Golden State Natural Resources. Drax is not yet legally committed to the project but has signed a nonbinding agreement that discusses financing and investment.\nThe California project presents itself as a desperately needed wildfire mitigation measure, declaring that “by transforming excess and unmarketable biomass and fire fuels into higher-value wood products, Golden State Natural Resources will create jobs, stimulate rural economies, and begin the process of mitigating dangerous wildfire conditions.” But Drax’s involvement has raised alarm bells for local activists, who worry that the projects will bring the same problems plaguing communities in the Southeast and Washington state to California.\nRita Vaughan Frost, forest advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Drax’s involvement “wipes away the sheen of this being truly for wildfire mitigation or economic development. We can see it for what it really is, which is a profit-driven measure.”\nDrax said that it was untrue to suggest that the scheme was purely profit driven, rather than intended for economic development or wildfire mitigation.\nPatrick Blacklock, the CEO of the Rural County Representatives of California, confirmed, however, that profitability is a key objective. When asked why pellet mills were chosen over less controversial methods of wildfire mitigation, the Yolo County administrator said that “candidly, part of the reason is we wanted to find a commercially viable pathway.” He added that Wade Crowfoot, California’s secretary of natural resources, had stressed the importance of commercial viability “at a recent meeting” with Blacklock.\nBlacklock said he is aware of Drax’s history of noncompliance with environmental regulations in the Southeast, but claimed the California plants will be “different.”\n“I think it comes back to this being community-led and public agency-led. That’s not how public agencies operate,” he said. “We operate to the letter of the law. We operate to the commitments that are made on environmental review.”\nBut Craig Ferguson, senior vice president of the Rural County Representatives of California, appeared to contradict this point in a meeting that Blacklock also attended, warning that the project is unlikely to remain in total control of the public agency.\n“If we’re going to build facilities, we’re talking hundreds of millions of dollars, and we’re going to have to expect that those people putting the money up are going to expect some kind of control,” Ferguson said in May.\nNick Joslin, a program manager at the Mount Shasta Bioregional Ecology Center, located in the sourcing radius of the Lassen site, has questioned the claims that the new project would bring good jobs to the area.\nBoth mill sites are in parts of the state that once had strong lumber industries, and Joslin confirmed that locals he has spoken with seemed happy to have any mill back in the area for employment purposes. But Joslin believes that the pellet plants would be different than the industries that supported communities in the past: “Inside these industrial facilities, there aren’t that many jobs … and the jobs would be maintenance work in extremely hazardous conditions.”\nRural County Representatives of California also publicly opposed legislation in 2022 that would have set a minimum wage standard for forestry jobs.\n“Ultimately they want people to be able to work in forest jobs again, but not to pay them well. That was a little shocking for everybody to see,” said Joslin.\nSince 2021, Golden State Natural Resources has spent $150,000 lobbying the California government, some of which relates to workers’ wages. In 2023, after its parent group publicly opposed the bill that would set a “prevailing wage” pay floor for workers on “fuels reduction projects” — a category the proposed mills would fall under — Golden State Natural Resources spent $45,000 lobbying on the bill.\nThe agency’s own board members have even expressed concern over overblown promises of employment. “We’re promising to put local people to work. And the only local people we are going to be putting to work is the guy cleaning up the trailer park after the workers all leave,”  Humboldt County Supervisor Bohn told the board in May.\nLocal activists are currently awaiting the release of the project’s draft environmental impact review, slated for September after multiple delays.\nIn the meantime, Vaughan Frost and other opponents of the project are focusing their efforts on persuading state and county officials not to “waste our money on projects that are boondoggles, as the risk of wildfires only becomes more urgent every single year.”\n“When I’m talking to policymakers, I put it this way: ‘Supporting Golden State Natural Resources is like jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire,’” said Vaughan Frost.\nA 2023 report found that without subsidies for generating green electricity — totaling 548 million pounds ($719 million) from U.K. bill-payers in 2023 — the entire Drax Group of 72 companies, including all the pellet mills, would operate at a loss.\nSo like any sensible profit-seeking endeavor, Drax is looking to diversify its income stream — by building a new series of pellet-burning plants in the U.S. that would rely on the same suspect carbon math to get subsidies from the U.S. government. If Drax wants its new U.S. mills to usher in new profits and growth, the facilities need to be a prelude to new power plants.\nThe long-continuing uncertainty around its U.K. subsidies only increases the pressure. The company failed to make the shortlist for a major new subsidy in 2023, and last month it coughed up 25 million pounds ($33 million) for regulatory breaches after misreporting data about wood pellet imports to the U.K. energy regulator Ofgem. Drax denied that the outcome of the regulatory investigation had anything to do with its pursuit of new revenue sources or the likelihood of future subsidies. The company told Land and Climate Review that the U.K. government is conducting a consultation on future support for biomass generators, which it welcomes.\nThe power company announced plans to construct up to 11 new biomass power plants across the U.S. and Canada last year, each with additional carbon capture and storage technology. With this new (and expensive) tech, the company plans on going beyond the already contentious claims that its U.K. power plant is carbon neutral to claim its new facilities will be carbon negative. In January, it launched a new subsidiary, Drax U.S. BECCS Development LLC to carry out the projects.\nHeadquartered in Texas, Drax’s new Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage arm claims it has already earmarked two sites in the U.S. South for power plants and that it is evaluating nine more across North America. Drax claims its first power plant project in the Southeast will require a $2 billion investment and is aiming to make a final investment decision by 2026.\nPrevious investigations have estimated that if all 11 plants matched Drax’s U.K. power station in fuel consumption, they would burn the equivalent of approximately 300 million trees a year and need to capture and store more than 100 million tons of CO2 in order to zero out their emissions. Drax contests these calculations, in part due to its carbon accounting methods.\nThe eligibility of Drax’s new power plants for federal subsidy will depend on whether the U.S. chooses to adopt the same controversial carbon accounting rules that allow Drax to report its power station emissions as zero in the U.K.\nThe company certainly appears to be pushing for this. Through its lobbying firm VNF Solutions, Drax has engaged the services of Mary Landrieu, the former U.S. senator from Louisiana who chaired the Energy and Natural Resources Committee when in office. Landrieu has lobbied on “legislation related to bioenergy with carbon capture and storage,” according to VNF Solutions’ lobbying disclosures.\nBiomass energy in the U.S. is at a juncture. In May, the U.S. Treasury proposed regulations relating to the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit. While the eligibility of biomass power plants was not addressed explicitly, the rule proposal stated that any “clean energy facility that achieves net zero greenhouse gas emissions” will be able to access the tax credit — which would apply to Drax’s plants if its preferred carbon accounting rules are adopted. It is one of a number of federal tax credits introduced through the Inflation Reduction Act that could help fund plants like the ones Drax plan to build.\nWhen asked if Drax was recruiting Rural County Representatives of California or its agencies to lobby for a power station in California, Blacklock, the RCRC CEO, said equivocally that “Drax definitely have that interest but candidly so do we. … We have some shared interests.”\nIn the last year and a half, Rural County Representatives of California has spent over $1.5 million lobbying the California government. In lobbying reports from January 2023 to June 2024, biomass is mentioned 13 times.\nIt is not yet clear whether the Democratic or Republican parties will take strong stances on biomass power. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to gut the Inflation Reduction Act entirely, which would no doubt disappoint Drax’s American CEO, who released a press release describing the “eye-watering” subsidies in President Joe Biden’s bill as “transformative” for the company.\nBut a Kamala Harris win is no guarantee of plain sailing for Drax, either. The Democratic presidential candidate is currently under fire for lacking a clear energy policy, and she may eventually find herself under pressure from other Democrats to exclude Drax’s business model from new subsidy regimes.\nMajor party figures have begun to speak out against the industry, such as Sen. Cory Booker, who said it exposes “low-income and minority communities [to a] disproportionate burden of environmental hazards and injustices.”\nAlong with other senior party figures such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Booker introduced a law to reform biomass carbon accounting in April. That same month, the EPA launched a research project investigating the health impacts of wood pellet plants.\n“They’re currently in the process of doing that investigation and are doing health impact analysis as well,” said Ashley Bennett at EarthJustice. “So I think that those are signs that this industry as it is currently operating is unsustainable.”\n“Clean energy should not lead to increased logging and forest degradation, and it shouldn’t create greenhouse gas emissions,” she said. “These facilities are just not good for the communities that they come into. They put public health at risk, put forests at risk, put the ecosystem at risk, and ultimately, they further exacerbate the climate crisis.”\nUpdate: October 1, 2024This article originally referred to Rita Frost at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

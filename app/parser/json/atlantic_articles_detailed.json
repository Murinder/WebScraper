    "text": "Donald Trump is most likely not trying to intentionally assemble a Cabinet chock-full of people accused either of sexual assault or of enabling it, but if he were, he’d be killing it.Former Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, who has been accused of “sexual encounters” with a minor and paying women for sex, withdrew his nomination for attorney general last month. Gaetz, who has denied the allegations, was in no way qualified for the position, but he met Trump’s main criterion of being likely to comply with the president-elect’s every decree. (In Gaetz’s stead, Trump has nominated former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who faces claims of more pedestrian political corruption.)Trump’s nominee to lead the Pentagon, the former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, has a military background, but he holds extreme views and beyond being another Trump toady is similarly unqualified to lead America’s large, complicated military bureaucracy. A 22-page police report describes an alleged sexual assault in California seven years ago—Hegseth has insisted that the encounter was consensual, and later entered into a financial settlement with the accuser; no charges were ultimately filed. Beyond the accusation, Hegseth’s statements about sexual assault and women reveal someone who appears to not take either rape or women’s contributions to the military seriously; he has, for example, suggested reversing the rule allowing women in combat roles, because they might be raped by their comrades. If Hegseth is innocent of the sexual-assault allegations, he would nevertheless remain unfit for the role.Trump’s nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is a staunch ally of preventable childhood diseases who belongs nowhere near a public-health position in the federal government, given his views on vaccinations alone. He also stands accused of sexually assaulting his former live-in nanny. (As The Guardian reported, when asked about the incident publicly, Kennedy acknowledged having “skeletons in his closet,” and later sent the nanny a text saying he had no memory of the incident but apologizing for making her uncomfortable.)Linda McMahon, Trump’s pick to ruin the Department of Education, is being sued alongside her husband, the wrestling magnate Vince McMahon, over allegedly having enabled the sexual abuse of underage “ring boys” who worked for what was then known as the World Wrestling Federation, now World Wrestling Entertainment. (The McMahons have also denied any wrongdoing.) McMahon’s husband reportedly remains under federal investigation for sex trafficking related to their business, and she has no background in education, other than a brief stint on the Connecticut Board of Education that ended shortly before the revelation that she had falsely claimed to have an education degree.Then there is Trump himself, who in a 2023 civil suit was held liable for sexually abusing the writer E. Jean Carroll. As Quinta Jurecic writes, “The choice to begin a new administration with this particular slate of picks represents a remarkable commitment to moral ugliness.” The message seems to be that allegations should be taken seriously only if they involve a certain class of persons.These allegations are credible because they are backed up by official documents, witness accounts, and in Trump’s case, a verdict. That gives them more weight than a mere accusation. Notably, no standard of evidence would make these accusations credible to many conservatives, because the individuals are Republicans, whereas unfounded claims of sexual misconduct against entire categories of people have been a basis for right-wing policy making over the past four years.Republicans spent much of the Biden years baselessly accusing LGBTQ people of being “groomers” seeking to sexually assault children, and then passing discriminatory laws using those same unfounded accusations as justification. They then nominated Trump, who had admitted on the infamous Access Hollywood tape that he believed his celebrity status allowed him to “grab” women “by the pussy,” and sent him back to the White House. Trump spent his campaign smearing immigrants as sexual predators as well. The contradiction here can be understood as a key element of Trump-era conservative ideology, which is that such categories as “sexual predator” can apply only to groups that conservatives are targeting, and never to conservatives themselves. An immigrant or LGBTQ person is therefore a “groomer” until proved otherwise, whereas a conservative by definition cannot be one, no matter what they’ve allegedly done.For example, prior to Gaetz’s withdrawal, as reported by HuffPost’s Arthur Delaney, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told a reporter, “We’re not going to try Pete Hegseth or Matt Gaetz based on press statements.” When the reporter pointed out that the allegations against Hegseth had been outlined in a police report, Graham responded, “I don’t care.”Again, after several years of passing laws and demanding mass deportations on the pretext that sexual crimes are abhorrent and must be prevented without regard for the individual rights of entire groups of people, the response to such allegations made against a prominent Republican is “I don’t care.” Which at least has the virtue of being honest.Contrast this indifferent response with the treatment of Representative-Elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, the first transgender person elected to federal office. House Speaker Mike Johnson and the publicity-hungry Representative Nancy Mace—who just four years ago attempted to present herself as someone who “strongly” supports “LGBT equality” when that seemed politically advantageous—have spent recent weeks publicly trying to humiliate and bully McBride. Johnson set a House rule banning her as well as any other trans-women staffers or visitors from women’s bathrooms on Capitol Hill, and Mace proposed a federal law that would do the same for “members, officers and employees” of the House. Mace has presented her bill as an attempt to protect women from sexual assault.McBride, for her part, has said, “I’m not here to fight about bathrooms, I’m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families. Like all members, I will follow the rules as outlined by Speaker Johnson, even if I disagree with them.” Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that such “bathroom bills” ultimately have the perverse effect of making any woman deemed insufficiently feminine subject to suspicion, as well as forcing men to use the women’s room.As the writer Parker Molloy notes, the Republican fixation on McBride illustrates the folly of the punditocracy’s constant advice to Democrats to lay off “identity politics,” beyond the obvious fact that Trumpism is itself identity politics. Republicans get a say in which issues become salient, and if they want to make every news cycle about trans people or immigrants or whichever group they want to demonize, then they can do that. If Democrats then defend the rights of that group, prominent voices in the media will inevitably accuse the Democrats of being obsessed with identity politics, as though it was their choice to bring up the issue in the first place.The contrast between how Republicans react to conservatives actually accused of sexual assault and a trans person who simply exists is instructive. If you are a conservative, then you cannot be a sexual predator no matter what you have done. If you are a member of a community that conservatives despise and wish to justify discrimination against, then you are a sexual predator, even if you have never preyed on anyone. This is not principled opposition to sexual abuse; it is a commitment to disparaging entire groups of people in order to legitimize intolerance against them. These divergent reactions offer a grim shorthand for Trumpist politics, which seeks not to solve problems but provide scapegoats for those problems, and then hope that people are too distracted by hatred to notice.",

    "title": "RFK Jr. Is in the Wrong Agency",
    "author": "Nicholas Florko",
    "date": "December 3, 2024",
    "text": "Leading the Department of Health and Human Services seems, at first glance, like a dream job for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., quite possibly America’s most infamous anti-vaxxer. If confirmed, Kennedy will oversee the agencies that play a central role in researching, reviewing, and recommending vaccines. But promoting his own vaccination views will likely be a long push for subtle changes—rulings that Americans may get vaccinated, rather than should—and he’s said, at least, that he’s not aiming to “take away anybody’s vaccines.” Based on his recent public statements, he appears much more interested in cutting down on America’s consumption of seed oils, and frozen school-lunch pizza. In nominating Kennedy to lead the health department, Trump is kneecapping one of the few bipartisan issues he campaigned on this election: improving the diet, and overall health, of Americans. If Trump truly wanted RFK Jr. to fulfill those parts of their pledge to “Make America healthy again,” he should have picked a different job for the would-be health secretary.Since endorsing Donald Trump for president, Kennedy has pledged that he will “get processed food out of school lunch immediately,” argued that the government must stop subsidizing the crops that make seed oils, and urged Trump to stop allowing people to buy soda with federal food benefits. The “Make America healthy again” agenda also advocates for more comprehensive pesticide regulation, and for regenerative agriculture, which aims to improve soil biodiversity and limit chemical inputs. Kennedy won’t be able to do any of this as the head of the federal health department.Trump has already signaled that the EPA, which has the power to crack down on pesticides, is off-limits, because RFK Jr. “doesn’t like oil.” But Kennedy could have been an era-defining leader of the USDA, which regulates school lunches, doles out subsidies for oilseed crops, and sets rules for public-assistance programs including SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Before being nominated for HHS, RFK Jr. even posted an Instagram video filmed outside the Department of Agriculture, promising in the caption to enact the MAHA agenda “when @realDonaldTrump gets me inside the USDA.”At HHS, he’ll still have some influence over his favorite food-related issues, such as banning certain food additives. He’ll also have direct impact on the next round of federal dietary guidelines, which are due to be released in 2025. But HHS’s powers to change Americans’ food intake are either indirect or slow.To remove a food ingredient as health secretary, for instance, Kennedy would have to pressure the FDA to issue ingredient bans. Because Kennedy would oversee the agency, Marty Makary, Trump’s pick for FDA commissioner, would have to at least entertain that request, but even so, the agency would likely need years to pull any ingredient off shelves. Banning an ingredient requires significant science and legal justification. Earlier this year it banned brominated vegetable oil, a chemical added to certain sodas that has been banned in Europe and the United Kingdom for years. Right now, the agency relies on just a few people to do this kind of work. (The staff reviewing the safety of food additives is small enough that the head of the FDA’s food center recently boasted that he was able to add five full-time staffers.) Speeding up the office’s work—which includes policing new additives that food companies are regularly launching—would require more funding and cut against Trump’s pledge to limit government spending.But the negative effect of the food additives that Kennedy seems most worried about is felt by only a small subset of eaters. He has spoken, for instance, about a yellow dye known as tartrazine. He has claimed that the dye is tied to asthma, but a 2001 meta-analysis found that avoiding tartrazine “may not benefit most patients, except those very few individuals with proven sensitivity.” (Many of Kennedy’s other claims about the dye’s harms are highly debated among toxicology experts.) By contrast, a program to restrict soda in SNAP, as Kennedy has proposed, might require its own bureaucratic finagling at USDA, but could affect a significant portion of the 42 million people who use the program. Changes to school lunch, similarly, would affect some 28 million young people.Putting RFK Jr. at HHS also doesn’t totally make sense as a political decision. Confirmation fights are less contentious when the nominee has bipartisan bona fides; few Democrats support most of Kennedy’s health-care views, and his historically liberal views on abortion could cost him some Republican votes. But plenty of liberals like his take on food and agriculture. As HHS secretary, RFK Jr. is also likely to be dragged into the politics of Trump’s mass-deportation plan, an issue he’s largely steered clear of, because Health and Human Services is in charge of caring for unaccompanied children who are apprehended for being in the United States illegally. Trump’s last HHS secretary, Alex Azar, quickly became what Politico called the “public explainer and punching bag for the migrant crisis.” While Azar was getting tongue-lashed by Congress in 2018, RFK Jr. was tweeting that the policy amounted to immigration officials “forcing beleaguered parents to make Sophie’s Choice at America’s borders.” Trump’s USDA secretary will have to navigate calls from the farm industry to spare agricultural laborers from the administration’s mass-deportation plan, but as health secretary, Kennedy will likely have to be the face of any policy detaining migrant children, or openly criticize his boss.The person Trump did pick to lead the Department of Agriculture—America First Policy Institute CEO Brooke Rollins—has much less obvious interest in its purview than Kennedy does. Beyond an undergraduate degree in agricultural development, she doesn’t have any direct agricultural experience that prepares her for the job, and her current organization’s related policy work seems focused on concern over U.S. agricultural land being purchased by China.Trump’s choice to nominate RFK Jr. for HHS seemed like a last-minute decision. After all, in late October, a co-chair of the Trump transition team promised that Kennedy would not be picked to lead the department, only for Trump to name him to that position two weeks later. Maybe it just resonated as a sound-bite to have the head of the “Make America healthy again” movement lead the health department. Maybe Trump wanted to stash RFK Jr. at an agency where he can’t actually do much harm to the big food companies that have historically allied with the Republican Party. Either way, the result is that RFK Jr.’s desires to improve our food supply—the parts of his agenda that have the most bipartisan appeal—will be stymied at HHS. Trump put Kennedy in the position where he will both face the most political friction and be least effective. RFK Jr. might try to nudge or influence Rollins to his way of seeing things, but the health secretary demanding that the agriculture secretary change farm and food policy is the equivalent of the governor of California urging the governor of Texas to change that state’s immigration policy. It just won’t happen.",

    "title": "South Korea’s Warning for Washington",
    "author": "Brian Klaas",
    "date": "December 3, 2024",
    "text": "A right-wing wannabe authoritarian president—a leader who attacks the press, is accused of abusing power for personal gain, uses his power to block investigations into his family’s potential corruption, hopes to stay in office to avoid heading to prison, and only seems to have concepts of a plan to address his nation’s inflation and health care—declared martial law earlier today.This is not a dystopian fever dream for what may soon come to pass in the United States, but instead a rapidly unfolding crisis in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol shocked his nation with a hastily executed surprise power grab under the pretext of an unspecified military threat from North Korea and enemies within. Late Tuesday evening in Seoul, Yoon issued a statement calling the country’s National Assembly a “den of criminals” and claiming that it was undermining governance. Martial law was needed, Yoon claimed, to stop the “anti-state forces that are plundering the freedom and happiness of our people.”Within hours, protests broke out around the assembly building, and the lawmakers within it unanimously voted to overturn Yoon’s martial-law declaration. Clashes between protesters and law enforcement have continued since the announcement, and the demonstrations are likely to keep growing, demanding Yoon’s resignation.“I think Yoon is done,” Karl Friedhoff, a Korea expert at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, told me. “In his mind, he may have imagined this as a power grab, but this was more about sheer incompetence.”Korea’s civil society is strong, and mass protests have long been a signature element of its political culture. “If you’ve been to Korea and haven’t seen a protest, you haven’t really been to Korea,” Friedhoff quipped.Yoon essentially has been a lame-duck leader since South Korea’s April 2024 legislative elections, in which his party suffered devastating losses. Like many incumbents, Yoon faced the global headwind of high inflation. Yet much of his unpopularity was of his own making. One of Yoon’s top power brokers was allegedly paid to ensure that a certain candidate would be selected for their party’s nomination to a legislative seat; this scandal also linked the first lady to allegations of election interference and dominated headlines in recent weeks as potentially implicating audio from Yoon’s phone calls leaked to the public. Yoon has used his power to block investigations into his family’s alleged scandals. Along with perceived mismanagement of public services and the economy, these scandals have devastated Yoon’s popularity; a recent poll found his approval at just 19 percent.South Korea is the 12th-largest economy in the world and, aside from Japan, the most important democracy in East Asia. But it is also a comparatively young democracy, having emerged from authoritarian rule only in the summer of 1987, after the popular uprising known as the “June Democratic Struggle.” This matters because martial law is not an abstract concept to older Koreans, so much as it evokes a vivid memory of the country’s not-so-distant dictatorial past. The last South Korean coup d’état took place in 1980, after a general declared an expanded version of martial law and became president. That time, the popular backlash was crushed. Authoritarianism persisted for another eight years. (Many Korea experts and political-science indexes don’t count the Republic of Korea as a fully consolidated democracy until 2002.)Since then, South Korea’s democracy has made significant progress and been hailed as one of the biggest antiauthoritarian success stories of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It’s still fragile, however, and the country’s institutions have been showing signs of stress for some time. The stressors may sound familiar to Americans, despite a very different context. Gi-Wook Shin, a professor of contemporary Korea at Stanford University, wrote in 2020 that the country was facing a “democratic depression,” in which “opponents are demonized, democratic norms are eroded, and political life grows ever more polarized.” Politicians, rather than trying to cool tensions, have instead appealed to “chauvinistic nationalism.” (Unlike in the United States, however, two of South Korea’s living former presidents who broke the law actually served time in prison before they were pardoned.)Yoon’s power grab seems likely to fail. But invoking martial law—even for a few hours—does lasting damage to democratic norms. One of the core principles of democratic governance is civilian rule, which stipulates that the military provides security but has no role in political governance. Democracies collapse when that barrier is removed, such as when a coup d’état takes place. But even failed coups or failed attempts to execute martial law can crack the civil-military barrier. They remind everyone within the political system that one person—a power-hungry politician or a self-serving general—could destroy decades of progress in an instant. Establishing the norm that the military is outside the scope of politics takes years of good behavior, from those in military fatigues as well as those in suits. Wrecking it can take as little as one misguided decision.South Korea’s recent turmoil also illustrates what the late political scientist Juan Linz called the “perils of presidentialism.” Linz argued that democratic experiments tend to fail when they allow executive power to reside in a president rather than in a prime minister under parliamentary constraint. Writing in 1990, Linz warned, “Heavy reliance on the personal qualities of a political leader—on the virtue of a statesman, if you will—is a risky course, for one never knows if such a man can be found to fill the presidential office.” At the time, Linz pointed to one conspicuous exception: the United States.President Yoon’s seemingly failed bid to consolidate power under martial law is a cautionary tale for Washington on the eve of a second Trump administration. Sometimes, incompetent authoritarians botch plots to seize power. They still damage democratic institutions and norms in the process. And sometimes, the power grabs succeed—because presidential democracy is not protected by constitutions written with magical ink. Rather, it can survive its moments of greatest peril through the actions of brave people who cherish ideals more than power. As Linz warned, such people are not always in plentiful supply.",

    "title": "The Slow, Quiet Demise of American Romance",

    "text": "After Donald Trump’s reelection, a lot of women were angry: at the result, at what Trump’s return to office could mean for their lives, and at the many people who voted for him—especially the men. In the ensuing days, some of these women began suggesting, half-jokingly or in total earnest, a radical kind of recourse: a sex strike.Many of them cited South Korea’s 4B movement, in which women responding to what they describe as a damaging patriarchal culture have renounced not only sex with men but also dating, marriage, and childbirth. The idea of an American version drew a good deal of media attention—though not positive attention, for the most part. (“4B Is Not the Winning Strategy to Resist the Patriarchy People Think It Is,” a Time headline read.) It’s true that a 4B-style movement might never take off in the United States. For starters, it’s unclear what such a movement’s aim would be, or how it would effect political change here. (South Korea’s movement hasn’t exactly taken off either.) But a big shift is happening among straight American men and women—a parting of ways that began long before the election. Many people, perhaps women most of all, have been quietly turning away from heterosexual partnership.As a reporter covering modern dating, I’ve spoken with a lot of men and women who have reluctantly given up the search for love. I believe that people can have rich, fulfilling lives with or without partners; I also know that courtship has never been easy. But research supports the idea that, in recent years, the U.S. has seen a particularly pronounced crisis of faith in romance. The Pew Research Center, in an analysis of census data, found that as of 2019, 38 percent of adults were unpartnered—that is, not married or living with a partner—compared with 29 percent in 1990. In a survey Pew conducted that same year, half of single adults said they were not seeking dates. When Pew divided that result by gender, it found that 61 percent of single men said they were looking to date or find a relationship while only 38 percent of single women said the same.In other words, straight partnerships seem to be going out not with a 4B-style bang but with a whimper. And however subtle the shift might seem, it has huge implications for men and women: how they treat each other, whether they’re willing to trust each other, and how they’ll build their futures—together or apart.Years ago, the business journalist Jon Birger was working at Fortune when he noticed a trend. The men he knew seemed to have no trouble dating; they were all either coupled up or content being bachelors. His female friends and colleagues, meanwhile, “seemed to have everything going for them” but couldn’t find partners, he told me. They shared horror stories about their dates that he could hardly believe. He wanted to know what was going on—so he went looking for answers.That search resulted in his 2015 book, Date-onomics: How Dating Became a Lopsided Numbers Game. His main takeaway was that college-educated women were competing for a shrinking number of similarly educated men, and that given this “man deficit,” they were facing a demoralizing dating scene. Starting in the 1970s, the share of bachelor’s degrees awarded to men began to drop; more recently, the number of women enrolling in and completing college has surpassed the number of men to a significant extent. Many college-educated women look for partners who feel equal to them in terms of education or career ambitions—and simply can’t find them.But even if these women don’t prioritize dating a man with a degree or a prestigious job, many of the men without those credentials don’t want to date them. In the U.S. and elsewhere, Marcia C. Inhorn, a Yale anthropologist, told me, mainstream cultural tradition has encouraged women to engage in hypergamy: “marrying up to a slightly older man, somebody who’s more career advanced, makes more money.” Men, meanwhile, have tended toward hypogamy, marrying someone younger, less well off, and less academically accomplished. Those norms are still so ingrained that as more women have made advances at school and work, many men have held it against them. That women’s hard-earned achievements disadvantage them romantically is a dark irony.Men are feeling penalized too. Daniel A. Cox, the director of the Survey Center on American Life, talked with young men while reporting his forthcoming book, Uncoupled, on the U.S. gender divide. Many discussed watching the women around them flourish, while the men themselves floundered. “If you look around the classroom,” Cox said, describing these men’s perspectives, “it’s their female peers who are killing it … They’re the leaders of all these clubs. They’re going to college at much higher rates. And then when they get to college, they’re doing much better.” Disparity in educational attainment is not men’s only point of grievance. They experience, for instance, higher rates of addiction and suicide, and report having fewer friends. Many men Cox has spoken with are aware of the ways some of their peers are faltering. At the same time, they’re hearing cultural conversations about “patriarchy and male advantage,” Cox told me, and they feel that those critiques are unfair coming from women they see as succeeding spectacularly.But those formidable young women aren’t having a good time either. Cox has heard from girls in high school whose boyfriends pressured them into sending nude photographs, which he said then got “passed around like trading cards.” He has heard from women who are constantly afraid of being sexually assaulted, or who find that the men they date always seem to expect sex but don’t seem interested in having a conversation. Inhorn similarly noted that in her discussions with women, “there was a lot of grimness, just about the way men treated women … a sort of gender despair.” Cox has found that both women and men believe that their gender disadvantages them. When so many men feel underappreciated and so many women feel mistreated, it creates a vicious cycle of resentment.Dating complete strangers probably doesn’t help—yet that’s how most people do courtship these days. The anonymity provided by apps precludes accountability: No mutual friends will find out if you acted like a jerk on a date. Birger told me that this can result in even worse behavior from some college-educated men, who might feel emboldened by having numbers on their side. (“Lopsided gender ratios turn some nice guys into monsters,” he wrote in Date-onomics, describing men who promised to text back and never did, who insulted women’s bodies, who cavalierly dumped people they were fond of because they were confident they could find other great options.) And without input from shared acquaintances—useful context for personality quirks, or reasons to empathize with someone else’s views—both men and women might be more likely to make snap judgments after only a date or two, and walk away.They might be quicker to judge based on political differences, for example—to see the other person as a proxy for a party or a principle, rather than as a complicated human being worth engaging in debate. A political gap between American women and men already existed before the election: Men have aligned more with the right and women with the left. In November, young voters seemed to diverge even more starkly based on gender. Cox told me he doesn’t believe that this will split a huge number of long-term couples. But he does think it will prevent a lot of new prospects from giving each other a chance.For those seeking romance, political differences might only worsen what was already a dispiriting state of affairs: In Pew’s 2019 survey, 75 percent of respondents said that finding a date in the past year had been difficult, and 67 percent said that their dating life wasn’t going well. Among the people who said dating had gotten harder in the past 10 years, women were twice as likely as men to say that it now involved more risk—both physical and emotional. In 2022, Pew found that women were 9 percent less likely than men to report positive experiences with online dating.As American women and men grow more discouraged, it’s not hard to imagine more straight people giving up on sex and dating—motivated not by allegiance to a cause or a group but by exhaustion and self-protection. If that happens, relationships, families, and communities will transform. In some ways, they’ve already started to.Women, for instance, are freezing their eggs at growing rates. Many commentators have assumed that the trend is the result of women prioritizing their careers, but Inhorn has found that the large majority would have children sooner rather than later if they could; they’re simply struggling to find a co-parent. For her book Motherhood on Ice: The Mating Gap and Why Women Freeze Their Eggs, she spent a decade interviewing more than 150 women undergoing the egg-freezing process, 82 percent of whom were single; of the 18 percent who were partnered, half felt that their relationship wasn’t stable enough for parenthood, and others did not believe that their partner was ready. Almost everyone’s reason for egg freezing, she told me, was “incredible frustration, sadness, anxiety surrounding partnership.” In fact, most women who freeze their eggs never use them, often because they don’t find a partner, Inhorn told me. Not everyone has the resources, the support, or, frankly, the desire for single parenthood.Even if a withdrawal from relationships isn’t initially meant to be political, it can still become so, Rosanna Hertz, a Wellesley College sociologist and the author of Single by Chance, Mothers by Choice, told me. She refers to many “single by chance” mothers as “reluctant revolutionaries.” They end up on an unconventional life path only because the standard route—finding a heterosexual relationship and starting a family—didn’t work out, despite years of trying. (“They don’t get up one morning,” she told me, “and say, Gee, I’m sitting around in my pajamas. I think I’ll order sperm on the internet.”) But some connect with other women who have run up against similar challenges; then they begin to talk about their experiences publicly. And in this national moment, when pundits are panicking about low fertility and marriage rates, people who quit dating, opt out of parenthood, or have children on their own are making a political choice, whether they intend to or not.Women should have every right to build a meaningful future that doesn’t require men, and if society is slowly moving to acknowledge that idea, you might call that a silver lining to the gender divide. But however well those alternative paths might work for some individuals, they’re unlikely to heal the societal gender rift. And they won’t change the fact that many straight men and women still want to find love. Cox, the author of Uncoupled, told me that when you survey people, the majority say they would like a long-term, stable relationship. “The sad part for me,” he said, “is that I don’t think there’s a fundamental shift in desire”—only in outcome. The sentiment he hears is “Ideally, this would not be my life,” but finding a partner is “too difficult. It’s too hard. And I’m having a lot of negative experiences that I just don’t want to have.”When I mentioned that I’d been picturing straight American romance as disappearing with a quiet little whimper, he thought that sounded right. He also offered his own metaphor: a slow, almost-imperceptible shrug.When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. Thank you for supporting The Atlantic.",

    "text": "A couple of weeks ago, my kitchen started to smell like sewage. The garbage disposal began to drip. The dishwasher wouldn’t drain. The toilet bubbled when my kids emptied the kitchen sink.At first, I thought the root problem was the broken disposal. But we fixed that and the kitchen still stank. Maybe it was the dishwasher? No, the dishwasher was fine. Only then did I call a plumber, who immediately knew what the problem was: “Your drainpipe is clogged. We see it all the time.” A guy came over to bust the clog. Problem solved.I had a mental model of what was wrong in my kitchen, but my mental model turned out to be bad. That’s only natural: I’m a lawyer, and not a handy one. The plumber had a good mental model. He’d seen the same constellation of symptoms before. He made a sharp guess about the root cause, and he knew how to fix it.I thought about mental models when Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy released an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal making their first major statement about the soon-to-be-created Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. In some ways, I liked what I read. I share their conviction that government has become too bureaucratized, rigid, and slow. I agree that radical change is needed.Musk and Ramaswamy smell the same crap that I do. But I fear they’ve got a bad mental model about what’s wrong. They think we’ve got too many civil servants—their equivalent of the garbage disposal. They aren’t paying nearly enough attention to the clogs in the drainpipe, including the finicky legal and procedural rules that will predictably frustrate their reform efforts. Unless they change what they’re up to, I doubt they’ll make much progress.In Musk and Ramaswamy’s telling, the chief problem with the administrative state is that it’s full of unelected mandarins who force their diktats down the throats of a reluctant public. Worse, those bureaucrats often act without legal authority from Congress. They adopt regulation upon regulation without regard to their costs, blithely unconcerned about the drag they’re placing on the economy.If that’s your model, going to war against the bureaucrats makes sense. And that’s what Musk and Ramaswamy aim to do—with, they seem to expect, the help of the Supreme Court. They promise to quickly rescind the regulations adopted by hyperactive officeholders. With fewer rules on the books, they say, there will be less need for bureaucrats to enforce them, providing a justification for “mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy.”For support, they point to two recent Supreme Court cases, Loper Bright v. Raimondo and West Virginia v. EPA. In the first, the Court overturned the doctrine of Chevron deference. As a result, the federal courts will no longer defer to agencies when those agencies interpret ambiguities in the laws that they administer. In the second, the Supreme Court admonished the EPA after it adopted a creative approach to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Only Congress, the Court said, can resolve “major” economic or political questions.Musk and Ramaswamy believe that “these cases suggest that a plethora of current federal regulations exceed the authority Congress has granted under the law.” They want to target “illicit rules” adopted in the prior, more permissive regime.Sure, agencies sometimes push the legal envelope. And those cases tend to attract headlines, which is why they shape our thinking about the administrative state. They are the exception, however; agencies have clear legal authority to adopt most of the rules they’ve adopted.A few days after Loper Bright came down, for example, the National Park Service banned bear baiting under a law telling it “to conserve … the wild life” of the parks. It’s very hard to see anything “illicit” about such a routine exercise of delegated power. The U.S. Code is full of delegations like this because Congress doesn’t have the bandwidth or the expertise to establish every detail of government programs. Instead, it writes general laws and instructs agencies to fill in the specifics. And agencies still get deference, even under Loper Bright, when they act within “the boundaries of th[eir] delegated authority.”That describes most of what agencies do. Last month, for example, the IRS adopted new rules about tax credits for new semiconductor facilities under the CHIPS Act. Why? Because Congress told the IRS to “issue such regulations” as needed to carry out the law. Last Wednesday, the National Marine Fisheries Service adopted a rule limiting the sardine catch in fisheries off the Pacific Coast. The agency had similarly unimpeachable legal authority to do so.Don’t get me wrong, there are lots of dumb rules. It’s just that most of those rules are squarely within their agency’s remit. Although that doesn’t make them any less dumb, it does mean that pointing to Loper Bright and West Virginia v. EPA won’t help get rid of them.What’s more, Musk and Ramaswamy get it backwards when they say that the cases give them extra powers to undo existing regulations. In fact, the cases constrain their authority. Imagine that an agency, for example, has an old rule on the books that is based on an interpretation of the law that DOGE dislikes. Before Loper Bright, the agency could have changed that interpretation so long as the new interpretation was also “reasonable.” The agency was free, in other words, to toggle between different ways of reading an ambiguous law.After Loper Bright, toggling is verboten. An agency that has already adopted the soundest interpretation of a law can’t change its mind. It’s stuck. If the agency were to try to adopt a new reading of the law—perhaps one that DOGE prefers—and to use that to justify rescinding the rule, the courts would stop the agency. Saying that Loper Bright gives DOGE flexibility is about as sensible as saying that handcuffs help when throwing a baseball.Much as DOGE might wish it were otherwise, rescinding a rule requires agencies to go through a cumbersome, multiyear rule-making process. Working to streamline that process would be a terrific mission for DOGE, and I hope Musk and Ramaswamy pursue it. Instead, they said that they’ll take a shortcut: The president will simply “pause the enforcement of those regulations” while they’re being reviewed.A unilateral pause won’t be as helpful as Musk and Ramaswamy seem to think. Many businesses, especially big businesses, have to certify their legal compliance to government agencies—most notably via financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, where false certifications can trigger criminal penalties under Sarbanes-Oxley. Few will feel comfortable ignoring rules that are still on the books just because DOGE tells them they might someday be rescinded.What’s more, you need smart bureaucrats to make sure that rescissions hold up in court. Under settled law, established way back in the Reagan administration, “an agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change.” Compiling that analysis requires technical skills that agency bureaucrats will have and that DOGE will lack. Slashing the federal workforce will thus work at cross-purposes to deregulation.Blanket nonenforcement is also, well, not so legal. As the federal courts have said, “An agency’s pronouncement of a broad policy against enforcement poses special risks that it has consciously and expressly adopted a general policy that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.” When that happens, the courts—with review up to the Supreme Court—are likely to intervene.Will they? Musk and Ramaswamy seem to think that the Supreme Court will be a foot soldier in the war they hope to wage on the bureaucrats. Again, I think their mental model is off. Six of the justices are conservative, that’s true. It’s also true that those justices have reservations about the size and scope of the modern administrative state. In general, though, the Supreme Court’s preferred approach to keeping agencies in check has been to insist on procedural fastidiousness.That’s not a passing fancy or a political spasm. It’s a cornerstone of the conservative legal movement, which is committed to the view that the courts must stand as a bulwark between the excesses of federal agencies and the public. The justices may like Donald Trump’s policies, and they may go somewhat gentler on those policies than they did on Joe Biden’s. They are unlikely, however, to abandon their commitment to the scrupulous enforcement of procedural rules to cater to his whims.Wishful thinking also characterizes Musk and Ramaswamy’s approach to cost cutting. In their op-ed, they seem to appreciate that more than half of all government spending comes from entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. They likewise admit that only Congress—not DOGE—can shrink those programs. Nevertheless, they think they can make substantial headway because of “the sheer magnitude of waste, fraud and abuse that nearly all taxpayers wish to end.”They’re right about the waste, fraud, and abuse. I hope they tackle it. The trouble is that, in their apparent mental model, making those cuts will be easy, because no one likes waste, fraud, and abuse. On that, they’re mistaken.For a characteristic example, look at how Medicare pays for drugs. When physicians dispense (say) a chemotherapy drug in an outpatient facility, they’re allowed by law to bill the government for 106 percent of the drug’s average sales price. Because 6 percent of a big number is more than 6 percent of a small number, physicians have a huge financial incentive to prescribe the most expensive drugs, even when a cheaper and equally effective alternative is available. That helps explain why Medicare drug spending has exploded, growing an average of 9.2 percent a year from 2008 through 2021.I’d call that wasteful. Would oncologists? Back in the Obama administration, Medicare proposed changing the statutory formula to make it mildly more sensible. Unusually, Medicare has broad legal authority, conferred in the Affordable Care Act, to do so by legal fiat. Nonetheless, the attempt fell victim to an intense lobbying campaign from hospitals and doctors.The point generalizes. The health economist Uwe Reinhardt called it the Cosmic Law of Health Care: “Every dollar of health spending is someone else’s health-care income, including fraud, waste and abuse.” If you really wanted to cut federal spending, you wouldn’t declare war on bureaucrats. You’d declare war on hospitals and physicians. Does DOGE have the stomach for that?If not, Musk and Ramaswamy’s claim that they will reduce government spending by “impoundment” won’t come to much. Their idea is that Trump could simply refuse to spend some of the billions of dollars that Congress has appropriated. A Nixon-era law called the Impoundment Control Act prohibits the president from doing so; Musk and Ramaswamy insist that the law is unconstitutional—and that the Supreme Court would agree.I wouldn’t be so sure. Trump’s allies have tried to build the legal case to support this constitutional argument, but it’s both untested and unpersuasive. Congress’s powers are at their zenith when it comes to federal spending on domestic programs. As early as 1838, the Supreme Court rejected the claim that the president can refuse to spend money as Congress has directed: “To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the constitution, and entirely inadmissible.”In any event, if all of this spending is so unpopular, why not pass a law to cut it? Republicans will hold the White House and both chambers of Congress come January 20, and the Senate filibuster is no impediment to spending cuts. Yet going to Congress is not Musk and Ramaswamy’s style. They want to “driv[e] change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than by passing new laws.”That dismissive attitude toward Congress betrays the limited scope for DOGE’s reforms. It also replicates the problem they say they want to fix—that unelected people (like, ahem, Musk and Ramaswamy) are making law instead of elected officials. If they really believed what they’re saying—that “our nation was founded on the basic idea that the people we elect run the government”—Congress would be at the center of their plans, not an afterthought.DOGE may make progress on selected problems, of course. Musk and Ramaswamy are dead right, for example, that the civil service is in desperate need of fixing, and that Trump has an unusual degree of freedom to rethink it. The procedures that apply to federal hiring are Kafkaesque, and firing civil servants is next to impossible.Even there, however, Musk and Ramaswamy seem to care only about the firing part, and not about the hiring. That’s a problem. As the economist Tyler Cowen has written about the administrative state, “dismantling it, or paring it back significantly, would require a lot of state capacity—that is, state competence.” If Musk and Ramaswamy have ideas about how to bring the best and the brightest into government, they’re not sharing them.Maybe Musk and Ramaswamy can pivot. Maybe they will be more creative, daring, and capable than I expect. For now, however, it looks to me like they are coming at the problem with the wrong mental model and a half-baked belief that they can achieve change through sheer force of will. I admire the ambition, and I share their concern about government dysfunction. But I fear they have no clue how to fix it.",

    "author": "John Hendrickson",
    "date": "December 3, 2024",
    "text": "The image is black-and-white, lending it an air of “historical artifact”: A modern-day Donald Trump standing next to Elvis Presley. The president-elect posted the picture on Truth Social last night. Presley is strumming a guitar; Trump is idling in the frame. Of course, this scene is impossible, and it’s not a real photograph. Elvis died in 1977, when Trump was 31 years old. Nevertheless, here’s Trump, side by side with the King, not smiling, not singing, just … hanging out. There is no punch line, or even a semblance of a joke. It is literally just something to look at.Amid a string of recent Cabinet-nomination announcements, the incoming president chose to share this image with his millions of social-media followers. The people responding in the comments loved it, and some replied with similar images, most of which appeared to be AI-generated. You could say that this is harmless. But what is it adding to the world? How is this even entertainment?The heavy sigh and slightly hungover feeling this type of content elicits might best be described as brain rot—Oxford’s 2024 Word of the Year.Brain rot is marked by a “supposed deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as a result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging.” It has a symbiotic relationship with internet garbage, or, as shoddily made AI-generated content has been deemed, slop, some of which is created by spammers who find financial incentive in flooding social platforms. Brain rot is the symptom, not the disease: It stems from this daily avalanche of meaningless images and videos, all those little tumbling content particles that do not stir the soul.And yet these ephemera nonetheless seep into our skulls. Slop has a way of taking up valuable space while simultaneously shortening our attention span, making it harder to do things like read books or other activities that might actually fulfill us. Brain rot doesn’t hurt; it’s dulling, numbing, something more like a steady drip. You know you have it when you have consumed but you are most certainly not filled up. And the deluge of disposable digital stuff often feels like a self-fulfilling, self-deadening prophecy: Rotting brains crave more slop.The Trump era, and especially the current phase in which we find ourselves, is likewise the era of brain rot, of junk, of exhaustion. My colleague Charlie Warzel argued over the summer that the MAGA aesthetic, in a word, is slop: “The high-resolution, low-budget look of generative-AI images appears to be fusing with the meme-loving aesthetic of the MAGA movement,” he wrote. He’s right, though it’s important to acknowledge that slop (and its attendant brain rot) transcend politics. Even if you tune out the news, you’re still bound to deal with the never-ending stream of meaningless digital debris. Take, for example, the slate of popular Netflix reality shows, which often feel designed to watch while you’re looking at something else on your phone. These programs are like a televised Yule Log, flickering in the background for comfort but not actually providing much of anything.Though it seems highly modern, brain rot, as a phrase, dates back to Henry David Thoreau, the transcendentalist contemporary of Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of the founders of this magazine.As Oxford University Press notes on its website:Today, Walden Pond, outside of Boston, is one of the surest places one can visit to alleviate brain rot. You can swim in the cool reflective water, stare at the swaying trees, wander along the muddy shore. I went a few summers ago and felt more offline than I had in a while.Oxford itself has received flack for being too online in its Word of the Year choices: Last year was the comparatively peppy rizz, while the year before was something more of a brain rot brethren: goblin mode. But getting mad at words is like getting mad at the weather. For better or worse (almost certainly worse), the distinction between our online and offline lives has been vanishing for years, and the line is now all but gone. The best thing we can do is see it all as life itself, and know that whatever feeling we are dealing with is a version of what Thoreau dealt with 170 years ago. Only slightly more stupid.Related:Here are four new stories from The Atlantic.Today’s NewsEvening ReadIt’s Never Too Late to Learn an InstrumentBy Caroline Mimbs NyceRead the full article.More From The AtlanticCulture BreakWatch.

    "title": "Misogyny Comes Roaring Back",
    "author": "Sophie Gilbert",
    "date": "December 3, 2024",
    "text": "Throughout American political history, two capable, qualified, experienced women have run for president on a major-party ticket. Both have lost to Donald Trump, perhaps the most famous misogynist ever to reach the highest office. But in 2024, what was even more alarming than in 2016 was how Trump’s campaign seemed to be promoting a version of the country in which men dominate public life, while women are mostly confined to the home, deprived of a voice, and neutralized as a threat to men’s status and ambitions.This time around, I wasn’t hopeful. I didn’t let myself entertain any quixotic notions about what having a woman in the most powerful position in the world might mean for our status and sense of self. I simply wished for voters to reject the idea, pushed so fervently by those on Trump’s side, that women should be subservient incubators, passively raising the next generation of men who disdain them. This wish did not pan out. “Your body, my choice. Forever,” the white-supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes, who has dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, posted on X on Election Night. “Women threatening sex strikes like LMAO as if you have a say,” the right-wing troll Jon Miller wrote on the same site.For Trump, eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion was apparently only the beginning. Bolstered by that definitive Supreme Court win and flanked by a hateful entourage intent on imposing its archaic vision of gender politics on the nation, the Trump-Vance ticket seemed to outright reject ideas of women’s autonomy and equality. Theirs was a campaign of terminally online masculinity, largely designed for men, expressed in brutish terms of violence, strength, and power. Trump insisted, in one late campaign appearance, that he would be a protector of women, “whether the women like it or not.” The vice president–elect, J. D. Vance, was revealed to have personal disgust for child-free women, whom he had described as “cat ladies” and “sociopathic.” He’d also, on one podcast, affirmed that the entire function “of the postmenopausal female” was caring for grandchildren. The super PAC founded by Elon Musk, who has shown great enthusiasm for personally inseminating women, released an ad referring to Kamala Harris as a “C word.” (The ad, which was deleted a few days later, winkingly revealed the C to stand for “Communist.”) And on X, Musk himself reposted a theory that “a Republic of high status males is best for decision making.” The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson excitedly compared Trump’s return to office to a strict father coming home to give his wayward daughter “a vigorous spanking.”None of this is new, necessarily. But as of this writing, men ages 18 to 29 have swung a staggering 15 points to the right since 2020, according to an Associated Press survey of registered voters. A few years ago, researchers at Penn State found that people’s alignment with the ideals of “hegemonic masculinity”—the celebration of male dominance in society and of stereotypically masculine traits—predicted their support for Trump in the 2016 and 2020 elections. Since then, our cultural environment has been flooded with ever more avatars of dopey machismo: steroid-ingesting, crypto-shilling, energy-drink-chugging bros; YouTubers and podcast hosts and misogynist influencers, all profiting wildly from the juvenile attention economy. The language that the Trump-Vance campaign used was intended to resonate with this audience, even if it sounded asinine to everyone else. (“Tampon Tim,” the right-wing social-media nickname given to Tim Walz for approving a measure that supplies period products to Minnesota public-school students, is an insult only if you’re 8 years old or terrified of women’s bodies.)But the philosophy of the people soon to be in power isn’t informed just by emotionally stunted Twitch streamers and playground bullies. Peter Thiel, the entrepreneur and conservative power broker who did more than anyone to further Vance’s post-law career and helped fund his bid for Senate, wrote in a 2009 essay that women getting the vote had doomed “capitalist democracy.” Trump’s ally and former aide John McEntee posted on X in October: “Sorry we want MALE only voting. The 19th might have to go.” For all the attention-getting antics of Trump’s extremely online contingent, his brain trust consists mainly of very wealthy, very powerful men who think women’s rights have simply gone too far. Forget the hope for a female president, or the fury at the fact that a charming, hardworking, genuinely inspirational candidate like Harris couldn’t break through all the accreted layers of American prejudice. What is going to happen to women now?Not all Trump voters embrace misogyny. And preliminary exit polling shows that a sizable minority of American women voted for him this time; in an economy that’s getting more precarious for every successive generation, both men and women may have been swayed by the promise of prosperity. Still, the teased enforcement of outdated gender roles has clearly connected with young men in particular. Among voters ages 18 to 29, the gender gap was striking: about 16 points, according to the AP.The Trump-Vance administration can’t obligate women to go back to the 1960s, though. It can’t force women out of the workforce. And it can’t mandate that women be subservient to men, sexually, romantically, or professionally. One has to wonder, then, what will become of the men who have been reared on Andrew Tate TikToks and violent gonzo porn devoted to women’s sexual degradation. The gender divide is about to grow into a chasm.In the U.S., 63 percent of men under 30 are currently single, compared with 34 percent of women in the same age group, according to the Pew Research Center. This suggests that women aren’t the only ones who may ultimately suffer from this coming rupture in American life. So, too, will the men who have been trained to see women as disgusting, untamable, fundamentally inferior to them.For all Vance and Musk purport to worry about birth rates, I’d argue that they have done more to dissuade women from having children than almost anyone else, by enabling the radicalization and isolation of Gen Z men. For thousands of years, marriage was a necessity for women—a means of financial security and social acceptance. This isn’t true anymore. Many women simply aren’t willing or remotely motivated to attach themselves to men who denigrate them, or to stay in abusive marriages for the sake of their children, as Vance once seemed to suggest that they should.In my own circle of friends, I see women living contentedly alone rather than settling for men who don’t respect them. I see intelligent, kind, high-achieving friends thriving in their community, spending their own money, appreciating culture, taking care of their own needs and taking care of one another. Within hours of the election result becoming clear, Google searches went up sharply for South Korea’s feminist protest movement “4B”—a social philosophy that advocates for women not to date, marry, have sex with, or have children with men. (South Korea currently has the lowest fertility rate of any country in the world.)American conservatism has long fetishized motherhood in a way that made it proximate to power—mothers are lionized and even encouraged to seek political office, as long as it’s understood that they’re doing so on behalf of others. Sarah Palin, the first female vice-presidential candidate on a Republican ticket, tried to defang her own ambition by suggesting that she was just a hockey mom who got involved. But the kind of motherhood now being promoted on the right is much more passive, and powerless. It’s the kind modeled by the former Supreme Court clerk Usha Vance, who stands by silently while her husband weakly brushes off his racist fans’ attacks on his family. It’s also exemplified by the tradwives of TikTok and Instagram, who cater to the male gaze with their doe-eyed; paisley-smock-wearing; Kinder, Kirche, Küche performances of submissive domesticity.The gender dynamics of this moment cannot be a surprise to anyone. Since his arrival in politics, in 2015, Trump has made his thoughts on women abundantly clear. He’s propagated the idea that those of us who don’t flatter or agree with him are not just difficult but “nasty,” using the language of disgust to make women seem contaminated and morally reprehensible. He has shamed women for the way they look, for aging, for having opinions. (Those of us who have public personas online have experienced this sort of treatment too, and have seen it snowball with his encouragement.) None of this is in any way negated by his decision to make a woman his chief of staff, or to nominate women for key positions.Even before Harris officially became the nominee in 2024, Trump’s allies were attacking her in sexualized terms, subliminally linking female power to the so-called threat of unfettered female sexuality. Early in July, Alec Lace—the host of a podcast dedicated to fatherhood, if you can believe it—referred to Harris on the Fox Business channel as “the original Hawk Tuah girl,” a reference to a viral clip about oral sex. In August, Trump circulated a post on his social-media platform, Truth Social, that insinuated that Harris had performed sexual favors to establish her career in politics. In September, Semafor reported that a shadowy conservative network had been paying influencers to promote sexualized smears of Harris. In October, a billboard in Ohio briefly drew consternation for displaying a mocked-up image of Harris on her hands and knees, about to engage in a sex act. (It was paid for by a towing company.)The old analytical terms we use to describe sexism in politics aren’t sufficient to deal with this onslaught of repugnant hatred. Michelle Obama was right, in her closing argument of the 2024 campaign, to note that Harris had faced an astonishing double standard: Both the media and Americans more broadly had picked apart her arguments, bearing, and policy details while skating over Trump’s “erratic behavior; his obvious mental decline; his history as a convicted felon, a known slumlord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse.” She also captured the stakes of the election when she said that voters were fundamentally making a choice in 2024 about “our value as women in this world.” On that front, the people have spoken. But women don’t have to play along.All his life, Trump has ruined people who get close to him. He won’t ruin women, but he will absolutely destroy a generation of men who take his vile messaging to heart. And, to some extent, the damage has already been done.This article appears in the January 2025 print edition with the headline “The Gender War Is Here.”",

    "title": "Pardon Trump’s Critics Now",
    "author": "Paul Rosenzweig",
    "date": "November 13, 2024",
    "text": "Over the past several years, courageous Americans have risked their careers and perhaps even their liberty in an effort to stop Donald Trump’s return to power. Our collective failure to avoid that result now gives Trump an opportunity to exact revenge on them. President Joe Biden, in the remaining two months of his term in office, can and must prevent this by using one of the most powerful tools available to the president: the pardon power.The risk of retribution is very real. One hallmark of Trump’s recently completed campaign was his regular calls for vengeance against his enemies. Over the past few months, he has said, for example, that Liz Cheney was a traitor. He’s also said that she is a “war hawk.” “Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her,” he said. Likewise, Trump has floated the idea of executing General Mark Milley, calling him treasonous. Meanwhile, Trump has identified his political opponents and the press as “enemies of the people” and has threatened his perceived enemies with prosecution or punishment more than 100 times. There can be little doubt that Trump has an enemies list, and the people on it are in danger—most likely legal, though I shudder to think of other possibilities.Biden has the unfettered power to issue pardons, and he should use it liberally. He should offer pardons, in addition to Cheney and Milley, to all of Trump’s most prominent opponents: Republican critics, such as Adam Kinzinger, who put country before party to tell the truth about January 6; their Democratic colleagues from the House special committee; military leaders such as Jim Mattis, H. R. McMaster, and William McRaven; witnesses to Trump’s conduct who worked for him and have since condemned him, including Miles Taylor, Olivia Troye, Alyssa Farah Griffin, Cassidy Hutchinson, and Sarah Matthews; political opponents such as Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff; and others who have been vocal in their negative views, such as George Conway and Bill Kristol.The power to pardon is grounded in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, which gives a nearly unlimited power to the president. It says the president “shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” That’s it. A president’s authority to pardon is pretty much without limitation as to reason, subject, scope, or timing.Historically, for example, Gerald Ford gave Richard Nixon a “full, free, and absolute pardon” for any offense that he “has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 20, 1969 through August 9, 1974.” If Biden were willing, he could issue a set of pardons similar in scope and form to Trump’s critics, and they would be enforced by the courts as a protection against retaliation.There are, naturally, reasons to be skeptical of this approach. First, one might argue that pardons are unnecessary. After all, the argument would go, none of the people whom Trump might target have actually done anything wrong. They are innocent of anything except opposing Trump, and the judicial system will protect them.This argument is almost certainly correct; the likelihood of a jury convicting Liz Cheney of a criminal offense is laughably close to zero. But a verdict of innocence does not negate the harm that can be done. In a narrow, personal sense, Cheney would be exonerated. But along the way she would no doubt suffer—the reputational harm of indictment, the financial harm of having to defend herself, and the psychic harm of having to bear the pressure of an investigation and charges.In the criminal-justice system, prosecutors and investigators have a cynical but accurate way of describing this: “You can beat the rap, but you can’t beat the ride.” By this they mean that even the costs of ultimate victory tend to be very high. Biden owes it to Trump’s most prominent critics to save them from that burden.More abstractly, the inevitable societal impact of politicized prosecutions will be to deter criticism. Not everyone has the strength of will to forge ahead in the face of potential criminal charges, and Trump’s threats have the implicit purpose of silencing his opposition. Preventing these prosecutions would blunt those threats. The benefit is real, but limited—a retrospective pardon cannot, after all, protect future dissent, but as a symbol it may still have significant value.A second reason for skepticism involves whether a federal pardon is enough protection. Even a pardon cannot prevent state-based investigations. Nothing is going to stop Trump from pressuring his state-level supporters, such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, to use their offices for his revenge. And they, quite surely, will be accommodating.But finding state charges will be much more difficult, if only because most of the putative defendants may never have visited a particular state. More important, even if there is some doubt about the efficaciousness of federal pardons, that is no reason to eschew the step. Make Trump’s abuse of power more difficult in every way you can.The third and final objection is, to my mind at least, the most substantial and meritorious—that a president pardoning his political allies is illegitimate and a transgression of American political norms.Although that is, formally, an accurate description of what Biden would be doing, to me any potential Biden pardons are distinct from what has come before. When Trump pardoned his own political allies, such as Steve Bannon, the move was widely (and rightly) regarded as a significant divergence from the rule of law, because it protected them from criminal prosecutions that involved genuine underlying criminality. By contrast, a Biden pardon would short-circuit bad-faith efforts by Trump to punish his opponents with frivolous claims of wrongdoing.Still, pardons from Biden would be another step down the unfortunate road of politicizing the rule of law. It is reasonable to argue that Democrats should forgo that step, that one cannot defend norms of behavior by breaking norms of behavior.Perhaps that once was true, but no longer. For the past eight years, while Democrats have held their fire and acted responsibly, Trump has destroyed almost every vestige of behavioral limits on his exercises of power. It has become painfully self-evident that Democratic self-restraint is a form of unilateral disarmament that neither persuades Trump to refrain from bad behavior nor wins points among the undecided. It is time—well past time—for responsible Democrats to use every tool in their tool kit.What cannot be debated is that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris owe a debt not just of gratitude but of loyalty to those who are now in Trump’s investigative sights. They have a moral and ethical obligation to do what they can to protect those who have taken a great risk trying to stop Trump. If that means a further diminution of legal norms, that is unfortunate, but it is not Biden’s fault; the cause is Trump’s odious plans and those who support them.",

    "text": "Rebel forces swept into Aleppo on Saturday, capturing the city center in a lightning three-day offensive that seemed to show the slackening of Moscow’s grip on Syria. The symbolism was impossible to ignore: The Syrian regime’s brutal reconquest of that very city in 2016 had demonstrated Russia’s military effectiveness. Now Vladimir Putin’s Russia is preoccupied with Ukraine, and Aleppo has slipped from regime control.But Russia’s commitment to Syria has not actually wavered, and Russia is not really distracted. The advance of Syria’s rebels, led by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), reflects the degradation not of Russian attention but of the multinational ground forces supporting the regime of Bashar al-Assad. And Russia is not only not contemplating withdrawing from Syria—it looks poised to double down on its investment there, even if it has to rely on Iranian-backed forces and the cooperation of regional powers to do so.Syria is important to Moscow because intervening there in 2015 allowed Putin to reverse the narrative of Russian decline that had taken hold since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia would no longer be what then-President Barack Obama dismissed as a declining “regional power”—it was to be a decisive great-power patron of the Assad regime, and as such, it would rewrite the playbook of outside intervention in the Middle East. American-led interventions, such as the invasion of Iraq and the NATO campaign in Libya, shattered states and bred chaos. Russia would have the opposite effect, preserving Syrian sovereignty and regional order.To understand Russia’s military position in Syria, consider that when Moscow first intervened there, in September 2015, it did so with a surprisingly light footprint and a long-term plan to modernize and strengthen the Syrian military. Moscow deployed just 2,500 to 4,500 personnel to Syria at any given time, focusing on air power, air defenses, and special forces, while relying on Iran and its proxies to supply ground forces. Operating from Khmeimim Air Base, Russian tactical aviation supported ground operations. Long-range bombers in Russia, along with cruise missiles on Russian warships in the Mediterranean, targeted positions deep inside Syria. Moscow also contributed advanced air-defense systems including S-400s, S-300s, and Pantsirs, along with electronic-warfare capabilities.Moscow sent some special-operations units, military police, advisers, and artillery teams to Syria. But to retake territory from the rebels, it relied almost entirely on a network of Iranian-backed forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iraqi Popular Mobilization Units, the Afghan Fatemiyoun, the Pakistani Zeinabiyoun, and Hezbollah. Ultimately, the Kremlin sought to build the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) into a professional fighting force capable of independently securing Assad’s rule, and so it poured resources into modernizing the SAA’s command structures, improving battlefield coordination, and equipping units with advanced Russian weaponry.Russia’s approach appeared to be sustainable—even in 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and adjusted its military presence in Syria accordingly. Moscow redeployed some aircraft and an S-300 air-defense system to Ukraine, but Khmeimim Air Base remained highly functional. More significant, the Kremlin drew down its minimal presence on the ground, relying more heavily than before on Iranian-backed forces, to whom it transferred some of its command posts.The invasion of Ukraine also changed Moscow’s Middle East posture in another way. Since getting involved in Syria, Moscow had delicately balanced the claims of Iran and Israel. In 2018, it agreed to hold Iranian forces about 50 miles off from the Golan Heights. The invasion of Ukraine began to shift this equilibrium, as Moscow’s reliance on Iranian drones for that war pushed it closer to Tehran’s “Axis of Resistance.”None of this seemed like a major problem for Russia until Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Then, as the conflict in Gaza spilled into the surrounding region, Israel escalated from targeting weapons depots in Syria to systematically eliminating high-value Iranian and Hezbollah assets and personnel there. Russia could no longer remain neutral regarding Israeli strikes while simultaneously deepening its reliance on Iranian-backed ground forces. The situation worsened as Israel’s Lebanon offensive degraded Hezbollah, which was, after all, one of the forces Moscow relied on to sustain the status quo in Syria.The gaps in Moscow’s strategy have now become apparent. When HTS first struck Aleppo, the speed and surprise of the advance left Moscow little time to coordinate with ground forces or organize effective air support at the scale needed to counter such a major offensive. And the collapse of regime defenses revealed that Russia’s long-term strategy to professionalize Assad’s military had failed: At the Kuweires air base, Syrian forces surrendered without resisting. They abandoned valuable assets, including helicopters, aircraft, and advanced air-defense systems.These setbacks will not drive Russia out of Syria, however. The Kremlin has too much at stake. It has already leveraged its Syrian intervention to rebuild its Middle Eastern influence, positioning itself as an essential mediator among Iran, Turkey, the Gulf states, the United States, and Israel. Moscow has also secured lucrative economic contracts for the reconstruction of Syria.Given the stakes, Moscow will be compelled to adapt rather than withdraw. It will likely seek to strengthen military cooperation with Iran, including by finding a role for Iraqi militias and recruits in Syria. Reports indicate that this is already happening. Iran has also been recruiting on Telegram channels to replenish its Syrian brigades. These reinforcements may help offset Hezbollah’s losses, but they are unlikely to be as effective as the Russian- and Iranian-led campaign that carried out the Aleppo offensive in 2016.Russia will probably also try to negotiate with Turkey, which backs some of the rebel groups. Since Saturday, Moscow has uncharacteristically avoided criticizing Turkey over the rebels’ activities. This restraint suggests that Russia is preparing a diplomatic initiative—perhaps one that allows Russia to maintain its presence in some parts of Syria while accommodating Turkish interests in the northwest.Russia wouldn’t be seeking such an arrangement if it weren’t militarily weakened. Not only have Iranian proxy forces lost muscle; Syrian opposition forces have gained it. They are much better equipped and coordinated than they were in 2015. If they were to continue to Homs from their current position in Hama, they would effectively sever the Russian bases at Latakia and Tartus from Moscow’s modest deployments elsewhere in Syria.As consuming as the war in Ukraine has been for Russia, the Kremlin does not see it as superseding its Middle East ambitions. That’s because Syria is not just a military outpost. It is a cornerstone of Russia’s claim to great-power status, a theater where it can demonstrate its diplomatic reach and its counternarrative to Western interventionism. This explains why Russia continues to invest in Syria even as it fights a costly war in Ukraine. Moscow may adjust its tactics, but abandoning Syria would mean surrendering something far more precious than territory: Russia’s hard-won position as an indispensable power broker in the Middle East.",

    "text": "Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket CastsThe police murder of George Floyd in 2020 brought radical ideas—such as defunding police or abolishing police departments altogether—into mainstream policy conversations. Activists highlighted instances of police brutality and the unjust treatment of unarmed citizens, right as violent crime began to skyrocket during the pandemic.In a New York Times op-ed from that year famously titled “Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police,” the prominent organizer Mariame Kaba argued that police were not set up to go after “the worst of the worst” criminals, and that they spend most of their time “responding to noise complaints, issuing parking and traffic citations, and dealing with other noncriminal issues.” Kaba also argued that the cost of this “safe” world was that racial minorities were kept “in check through threats of arrest, incarceration, violence and death.” Kaba had lost faith in reform efforts that had failed to prevent deaths like Floyd’s, representing a growing perspective that policing and the criminal-justice system were making people less safe.But although a majority of Americans remain critical of the criminal-justice system, voters have recently backed so-called tough-on-crime ballot measures, such as one in California calling for harsher penalties for theft and drug crimes, and another in Colorado involving parole eligibility for violent offenders.So what do the data tell us about the connection between policing and safety?On today’s episode of Good on Paper, I asked that question to Jennifer Doleac, an economist and expert on criminal-justice policy who is the vice president of criminal justice at Arnold Ventures, a foundation focused on evidence-based policy making.The following is a transcript of the episode:[Music]Jerusalem Demsas: A little over a year ago, Gallup asked Americans to choose between two approaches to lowering the crime rate: first, direct more money and effort to go into addressing social and economic problems like drug addiction, homelessness, and mental health. Or option No. 2: more money and effort for strengthening law enforcement. Almost twice as many respondents chose “address social problems.”Now this is a bit of a false dichotomy. People didn’t have an option to answer “both,” and it is possible to invest in both of these. But there are monetary constraints, particularly for the local governments in charge of most policing. What this poll indicates is a widespread belief that the preferable crime-fighting strategy isn’t focused on policing.This is a complicated conversation. The question of whether police keep us safe raises many more questions before it can be answered: How are they keeping us safe? Safe from what? And, of course, who is “us”?[Music]My name is Jerusalem Demsas. I’m a staff writer at The Atlantic, and this is Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives.Today’s guest is Jennifer Doleac, an economist and expert on criminal-justice policy who is currently the vice president of criminal justice at Arnold Ventures, a foundation focused on evidence-based policymaking.Jennifer has been working on these issues for years. And I asked her to come on the show to unpack what we know about the impact of policing on safety: Is it true that investments in social-welfare programs can make police obsolete, as many activists have called for in recent years? Does increasing the number of police officers actually make us safer?Here to answer those questions, and more, is Jennifer. Welcome to the show.Jennifer Doleac: Thank you so much for having me.Demsas: So before the pandemic, it seemed that crime rates were on this long-term secular decline, right? Since the ’90s, murder and violent crime were down significantly nationwide. Property crimes were down nationwide. It felt like we were maybe approaching utopia.We had a bunch of great conversations about, Oh, all the criminal-justice reform we can have now, given that crime rates are really low. More people were amenable to that. What explained that long-term decline, before we get into what happened during COVID?Doleac: We don’t really know, which I think then made the uptick during COVID more concerning. There are a bunch of different theories. One is: We did a bunch of things during the late ’80s and early ’90s in response to rising crime during that period. And so we hired a lot more police. Prison sentences got longer—all kinds of things. And so probably some combination of that worked, and crime started falling.But there are also other theories about, you know, there were dividends to the war on poverty that had happened during the ’60s, and the next generation was much better off. We took lead out of gasoline, and so lead exposure for young kids was much lower. And so when those kids grew up, they were less likely to commit crime. There’s just a whole bunch of stuff that probably combined to pay big dividends over time and contributed to that long-term decline that we saw in crime.Demsas: And can you draw out—this is one of my favorite things—the connection between lead and crime. How does lead impact criminality?Doleac: Yeah. I should be better at explaining this because I talk about it all the time, but I will caution that I’m not a scientist. The reason lead is so damaging is that it mimics calcium in the body. All of our receptors in the brain that look for calcium—basically lead latches onto those and crowds out the calcium. And so it affects brain development in that way.And then it winds up leading to more impulsiveness and aggression and learning disabilities. And so it winds up reducing educational attainment, and that itself could increase criminal behavior later if you have worse labor-market options. But because it increases impulsiveness and things of that nature, it increases violent behavior during the teenage years. And so we see an uptick in arrests for, especially, violent crime beginning for teens and into early adulthood.Demsas: If you were to make a bet, what sort of theories are most attractive to you? Because from my perspective, given that policing is super local in this country—we do have state troopers and things like that, but you just have all these different police departments all over the country—there’s tons of variation in the way that they’ll hire people and the policies that they have.Given that that’s true, and you still see this long-term secular decline, I’m kind of pulled towards these more non-police policy explanations for things than the ones that are referencing specific changes that departments may have made.Doleac: Yeah. I think that’s my hunch, too. I still think it’s probably a combination of stuff. We’re not going to find the one thing we did that led to this big decline.But I think overall, I’m really convinced by the evidence on lead exposure and the impact that lead exposure has on later criminal behavior—and so not necessarily research around the crime decline in the ’90s, but subsequent research and just exposure, in general. And so it’s compelling to me that that could have had a really big effect, as well as these other anti-poverty measures that we took.But I think you’re right that things like policing are very local, but they do respond and are funded heavily by the federal government. And so through COPS grants, for instance, the federal government put a lot of money into local communities to hire more police at that time. So there was this sort of grand experiment where we increased the amount of policing during that period. It wasn’t just one-off local decisions.So yeah, I think my hunch is the same as yours, that it’s probably the other stuff that was going on then that contributed the most. But I don’t think we can totally rule out that some of the crime-reduction measures we intentionally put in place were effective.Demsas: So I want to switch tacks here a bit because the thing that pushed me to invite you to come on the show, even though you’re someone I’ve been thinking about for a while to bring on, is you tweeted something, I think a couple weeks ago. And you wrote: “One of the most consistent research findings in the [criminal-justice] space is that hiring more police reduces crime. We need more and better policing, not less—and that will require more funding.”And this is, I think—depending on your media diet—either the most anodyne statement that could possibly be made, or it’s extremely controversial. I want you to walk us through, how do we know—when you say something is one of the most consistent research findings in this space, what are you drawing from there? What are some seminal studies that you point to or meta-analyses in this space that have pushed you to believe that hiring more police definitely is causally reducing crime?Doleac: Yeah. I love this research area both because I think the punchline is surprising to most people, and I always like telling people research that can change their mind, but also because the really strong causal research really changed the field’s perception of this area.So it used to be that we—just based on strictly correlational evidence—you regress crime on the number of police officers, and you look at the correlation between those two things, and there’s no negative correlation. So it looks like, maybe, police cause more crime. But it turns out that that’s not telling you the causal effect of crime, because places with more crime will tend to hire more police officers. And so you’ll get this positive correlation, but it doesn’t mean police are causing the crime. It’s because the crime is causing the police, basically.And so then the credibility revolution happened in economics, and people got really serious about looking for natural experiments that could distinguish correlation from causation and measure these causal effects. And suddenly, every study that is serious about measuring that causal effect using these natural experiments finds, consistently across a whole bunch of different contexts, that hiring more police, putting more police on the streets in various ways, reduces crime.And so the way that they’re doing this—there are, I would say, two broad buckets of these studies: One is looking at actual hiring of police officers. The natural experiment is that the federal government gives out COPS grants to enable local departments to hire more police. And so departments apply for this funding, and then some get it; some don’t. There’s some sort of ranking of applications, and the ones just over the threshold get the funding, and the ones just below don’t.And so using that kind of setup, you can look at the departments that just barely got the funding, compare them with the departments that just barely didn’t. And the departments that got the funding hire additional officers, so the money matters and is used for its intended purpose. And you see crime fall, especially violent crime. So that, I think, is very compelling evidence that hiring that additional officer reduced crime rates. That was really the only difference between those departments.The other bucket of studies—Demsas: I’m sorry—is that across all crime rates, or is it violent crime? What’s it looking at?Doleac: People look at all different crime rates. I think, overall across these types of studies, there are effects on both types of crime rates, but it’s most consistent and largest for violent crimes, especially homicide.I think, you know, one additional caveat there is that putting more police around could increase the reporting of crime. So you might wind up seeing, you know—there could be different effects that are canceling each other out for the reporting of theft, for instance. Maybe theft is falling, but it’s reported more often when it does happen, and so you get this more muted effect on net. Homicide is very consistently reported, and so it’s generally a really good measure of what’s happening with violent crime.Demsas: And what’s sort of the magnitude we’re talking about here, like, per police officer or whatever? What kinds of declines in violent crime are we seeing?Doleac: Okay. So the best estimate is that you prevent one murder a year for every 10 to 17 police officers that are hired.Demsas: Okay. So that’s pretty expensive.Doleac: It’s expensive, but also, I mean, murder is expensive, right? Murder is really costly. So I think most economists think of that as a pretty big effect.Demsas: Okay. And then the second bucket of studies?Doleac: The second bucket of studies is on how you allocate police officers, or thinking about police presence. And so for instance, there are a lot of randomized controlled trials of hotspot policing. So that’s where you would pick a bunch of higher-crime areas of a city, and you put police officers on this street corner, and you don’t put police officers on that street corner. And then you see what happens across the two street corners. And crime goes way down when the police officer is standing there.And so that, you know, is very consistent with an overall idea that what’s happening here is that police are deterring crime. Just the presence of having more police out and about is having a big deterrent effect on crime, because you’re increasing the probability that people will get caught, and people respond in a very consistently large way to that.Demsas: So I think that if we hadn’t seen really prominent instances of police brutality and political movements kind of form to respond to that, this would be probably a pretty widely accepted finding. But I think that there’s a sense that these sorts of findings miss the types of violence that police themselves might perpetrate. Is there research that looks into the question of how much police brutality increases when you have increased police officers, or is it the case that more police officers reduce the incidence of police brutality? Like, how do we see that effect kind of play out?Doleac: Yeah, we don’t have great evidence on this, because police use of force is not consistently measured. Even if it’s collected internally, it’s not consistently shared with researchers. And so I think there’s a lot of effort right now going into measuring that sort of outcome, but it’s been harder to get our arms around it because the data just isn’t as easily available as reported crime.But there have been a bunch of efforts to measure things like the effect of a police killing, for instance—especially what seems like an unjustified police killing if the victim didn’t have a weapon—on people who live in the local area, especially young people and young Black and brown people who live in the local area. And you see that, you know, educational attainment goes down. Interestingly, voting goes up, which is perhaps good news—people respond to that perceived injustice.But yeah, I think one big development over the last several years is that researchers have become much more serious about trying to quantify what the costs of different types of police behavior are so that we can compare them with the benefits. And I would say that, right now, the real policy and research frontier is figuring out ways to maintain the benefits that we get from policing while we mitigate the costs.Demsas: Can you help decompose the effect here a bit? Because I’m interested in the mechanism by which more police are reducing crimes. What are the pathways that this is happening? Is it the case that, you know, with the hotspots, is it just the visibility? They’re there, so people are like, All right, I’m just not going to do this right now, because a cop’s there, but I’m going to wait for the cop to be gone, or I’ll go somewhere else and commit a crime. Or are they really good at solving crimes, or what’s actually happening here?Doleac: Yeah. So there could be these two different channels, right? One is pure deterrence that you see—that there’s an increased probability of getting caught, and that is what you’re responding to, or you have this sense that you’re more likely to face consequences for your actions, and so you don’t commit the crime.The other one is incapacitation. And so that’s where, you know, the police are just arresting everyone who’s committing crime, and so there’s no crime anymore. And what studies consistently show is, using the kinds of natural experiments, that you hire—you get a COPS grant, and you hire more police officers—and so crime goes down, but arrests don’t go up. And so that is pretty consistent across all of these studies.And so that leads to a general conclusion that what really seems to be happening here is that police presence—I sometimes globally refer to it as almost like a scarecrow effect. Like, you just put a cop on a corner, right? And you do see sometimes in a lot of cities. Generally, cops hate doing this—but sometimes their job is just to sit in their car in a high-risk area of town just to kind of be there. But you know, they’re assigned to do that because it’s really effective.Demsas: My friends in New York sometimes will complain that, you know, NYPD in the subway is just sitting there scrolling on their phones, but is your sense then that those people are actually really helping to deter crime?Doleac: Probably. Yeah. I mean, maybe they would deter crime more if they looked like they were looking around instead of at their phone, but yeah, I think that’s the theory.Demsas: So there’s this well-established idea in the criminal-justice literature that certainty of punishment is effective at deterring crime. So it’s not about making someone go away for 20 years, but if they know they’re going to get caught for committing a crime, it reduces the likelihood that they’ll commit further offenses.How does that interact with something you once wrote, which is that the best available data from the U.S. suggests that two-thirds of people released from prisons will be caught again within three years? So if people who are caught, arrested, and punished are likely to reoffend, how does that interact with arguments that certainty of capture and punishment is what reduces crimes?Doleac: I’ve never thought about it in those terms, but I think my general reaction to that is that people are probably committing a lot of crime before they get caught again. And so the general problem is that right now, for most crimes, the probability that you’re going to get caught is actually very low.If you just look at clearance rates—which we could have a whole separate conversation about what clearance rates really measure, etcetera, but it’s basically the probability that the police are going to make an arrest for a particular type of crime—the highest category is homicide, which is about 50 percent nationally. It’s a coin flip whether or not you’re going to get caught for committing homicide. When you look at stuff like motor vehicle theft, it’s, like, 10 percent.And so there is lots of evidence that people are deterred much more by the probability of getting caught than the punishment. That is because most people who are on the margin of committing crime are just not that forward looking. And so it doesn’t matter what the consequences are in 10 years. You know, adding five years to an already-long sentence, people are thinking about tomorrow, maybe, right? And so increasing the swiftness and the certainty of consequences, even if the consequences are relatively limited, will have a much bigger effect on behavior than continuing to have it be, like, a 10 percent chance that you get caught, but if you do win that very unlucky lottery, then you go to prison for 10 years. It just isn’t affecting behavior.Demsas: I guess this theory kind of implies that people will commit crimes if they have the opportunity to commit crimes or that there is at least some subset of the population. Do you have sort of a generalized theory of why people commit crimes, and do we have a sense about that at the population level?Doleac: As an economist, I think people respond to incentives, and that’s kind of the core, right? But incentives aren’t entirely about punishment or the probability of going to prison in the same way that they’re not entirely about money, right? It can be about just disapproval, social disapproval, social norms. And so if everyone around you is following the law, then you’re more likely to follow the law because you want to be liked, and you want to be an accepted part of society.If, you know—we see this often in countries where paying your taxes is relatively uncommon; you feel like a sucker if you pay your taxes, and so no one pays their taxes. And so there is this element to which there are social norms that we want to maintain, because that winds up governing behavior often much better than having to actually go out and enforcing the law through force can.Demsas: And I think I asked you this question because I think that there is sort of an alternative theory of mind here, which is that crimes are essentially always committed because of need—that people are committing crimes because there is some sort of deprivation, either in their literal physical need, like hunger, or they need to steal clothes for themselves, or that’s what’s going on, or they don’t have an opportunity to make money in a legal way, and they found a better way of making money through illegal channels. How much purchase do you put into that sort of theory of criminal behavior?Doleac: I think it’s certainly a factor but, clearly, for some types of crimes more than others, right? So for revenue-generating crimes—robbery, theft, selling drugs—that totally is going to be part of the motivation. And so giving people other better options can be part of the solution. For crimes like homicide, assault—just this whole other category of crimes that are more crimes of passion, where there’s no money coming from it—there’s not a financial incentive. It’s not just because you’re poor. So it just becomes more complicated.Demsas: So I want to return to the original kind of framework of this conversation, which is around this question of the question of policing’s impact on crime. And I think one of the things that complicates this for me is: Back in 2020, I wrote this article when I was at Vox—well, actually, I think it’s 2021—but it was looking at a preprint by this Ph.D. student, Travis Campbell, who was an economist. Or he was a Ph.D. student in economics, and I think now he’s an economist. And he was at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and he found that the effect of BLM protests was a 15 to 20 percent reduction in lethal use of force by police officers. So that was roughly 300 fewer police homicides in census places that saw BLM protests.But there’s a secondary effect that he also observes, which is essentially that there’s an increase in crime. And the way that I think that he would explain this, and the way that made the most sense to me, is that you see this increase in crime as a result of police officers—this is called the Ferguson effect—reducing their desire to kind of do their job. So either they’re somehow on strike, or they feel—maybe the most sympathetic version for them is that they feel—you know, worried about engaging in policing activities because of the backlash, or they feel kind of embarrassed or ashamed about their jobs now. They don’t really want to do them. And then the worst is it’s a kind of like an intentional F you to the public for being mad at them.And so that’s kind of like—I mean, you see kind of the wide range of that that exists. And it’s interesting because, I mean, the vast majority of BLM protests are nonviolent protests. We now know this from a lot of research. And so how do you think about this problem of largely nonviolent protests leading police forces to reduce their willingness to do the kinds of policing that reduce crime? Doesn’t that kind of feel like you can’t criticize the police, otherwise they’ll just stop reducing crime rates, you know?Doleac: Yeah, I mean, that’s definitely the taking their ball and going home kind of interpretation of that whole period. It does not make police look good; I agree. I don’t know that paper that you just mentioned, so I’m now eager to go read it. But there have been a bunch of papers looking at whether there does seem to be a Ferguson effect—that police backed off, reduced their effort, and basically what the impact on crime seems to be, and my general read is, similarly, that crime went up.So the reduction in effort was especially apparent with regard to low-level arrests, which actually doesn’t seem to matter very much. Like, that’s the kind of enforcement that maybe we do want police doing less of, right? Just arresting everybody for trespassing or disorderly conduct.But yeah, I mean, I think I agree that it is problematic if police essentially seem to be, like, holding communities hostage, saying, like, It’s our way or the highway. You know, You can’t criticize us, or we’re just not gonna enforce the law anymore.At the same time, the more generous interpretation here is that, you know, everyone wants to feel valued in their profession. And this is a hard and dangerous job. And suddenly, if the community that you are serving and protecting and putting your life on the line for every day is insulting you every time you turn the TV on or every time you go out in public, you maybe aren’t that excited to put your life on the line for them anymore.And that, you know, it’s still—most police departments across the country have a really difficult time hiring now. They’re all extremely understaffed. And that is forcing a lot of creativity about, like, Okay, well, what do we really need someone with a badge and a gun for, and where can we hire civilians to do some work? But given that we know that putting more police on the streets reduces crime, and given that I think we all would like for police chiefs to have the ability to hold their officers accountable and say, you know, If you’re behaving badly, I want to fire you, right, then we need a line out the door of other people who want to be cops.[Music]Demsas: After the break: the wild connection between air pollution and violent crime.[Break]Demsas: So you mentioned clearance rates earlier, and you said, you know, it’s about 50–50. That’s definitely true overall, but Pew Research from April, looking at FBI data, found that clearance rates for both violent and property crimes are at their lowest levels in at least 31 years. Police cleared roughly 37 percent of violent crimes they came across in 2022. Is your sense that this decline has to do with the Ferguson effect, or is something else going on here?Doleac: I think this is bigger than that. This has been a longer-term trend. People I talk to—I think it’s a combination of real changes in policing and perhaps less of a focus on solving crime and more of a focus on just being present, which maybe is by design. I think there’s also a potential positive spin on this, which is: If clearance rates are measured by just the probability that you’re making an arrest in a particular case, well, police officers can just go out and make an arrest. They can arrest somebody, right? It might not be the right person.What we want is them to arrest the right person. And as, especially, technology has improved over the past several decades, it has become much more difficult for police to get away with just arresting someone, right? Or a more generous way to put that is: It becomes much easier for police to get evidence that tells them whether this is the right person or not and prevents wrongful arrests and wrongful convictions.And so I would expect clearance rates to fall just because of that, but I don’t think we have any really rigorous studies of this—of how much should be attributed to that, and how much should be attributed to changes in types of investigations and policing. But this is something that, again, my team is talking to people all the time about. It turns out, you know, detectives in this country don’t get any real training. You get a bunch of training when you sign up as a new cop.Demsas: That’s just absurd. I can’t believe that. (Laughs.)Doleac: But there’s no detective training, right? So I’m having lots of conversations on the—Demsas: They just put you out on the street, and they’re like, Go solve crime?Doleac: They’re like, Figure it out. You’ve been a police officer for a while, and so now you’re usually promoted to be a detective. And so I’m having conversations with people now about, like, Okay, what if we started a detective school? What are some big, crazy ideas we could think of here to help people solve more crimes?Demsas: So one thing I want to get into here is how different the American experience is from the rest of the world and whether we can really even know if we have comparable analysis of this. Here in the U.S., of course, as we all know very well, crime increased. Was that an American phenomenon? And if so, why would that be?Doleac: I admit, I don’t pay as much attention as I used to to what’s going on outside of the U.S., because my job is now so focused on U.S. policy. My impression had been that crime went up everywhere during COVID. But even within the U.S., it was a very specific type of crime, right?In general, crime went down. It was really homicides and shootings that went up. So in most countries, there are not as many guns, and so you’re not going to have shootings go up. And guns are very effective at killing people, as you know. You maybe don’t see the big spike in homicides, but during that COVID period, people were just not out and about as much. And so if you’re at home, your house is not gonna be broken into. But for other types of crimes, you’ll see an increase. And so there was an increase in motor vehicle theft because maybe you aren’t using your car as much, and so someone can steal it more easily.What also seems to have happened—to the best of our knowledge, our best guess of what happened here—is that because people weren’t out on the street, you don’t have witnesses. You don’t have bystanders. You don’t have the Jane Jacobs–style eyes on the street to deter people from bad behavior.Basically, the only people who were out on the street were people who wanted to cause trouble. And so you wind up with more shootings, more homicides. And then that just became a vicious cycle where there’s retaliatory violence. And so even after the lockdowns ended and people were moving around again, you didn’t see homicides start to fall until a couple years later. So that seems to be what happened in the U.S.I think, again, similar to what was happening in the ’90s and afterwards, it’s really difficult to pin down the exact reason for any of these broad trends because there’s just so much else going on. I think of it as the crime equivalent of trying to guess what happens to the stock market. There could be lots of really good advice about how to make your business profitable, but that doesn’t mean you can tell me what’s going to happen in the stock market tomorrow. And it seems similar to me. Like, I can talk all day about what we should do to reduce crime. I cannot tell you what’s going to happen to crime rates next month.Demsas: So I want to steel man a bit the position of “defund the police” advocates, because many of the people who were arguing for cutting police budgets during 2020 were advocating redirecting those resources towards investments in social-welfare programs. And you have, in your research and work, pointed to many such programs that have welcome impacts on crime rates.But what I want to ask is: How do we weigh these things against one another, given that, of course, municipalities have limited budgets, right? You have this pretty robust finding that 10 to 17 more officers is reducing one murder a year. Are there similarly cost-effective social-welfare programs that can prevent violent crimes at the same rates as police? Or is this just complimentary, but you cannot actually achieve the same effect?Doleac: Yeah. I think the biggest challenge here with substituting completely is just the time horizon we’re talking about, right? So if the problem you’re trying to solve is gang violence that’s on your street right now, investing in K-12 education is not going to help, right? That’s a long-term solution. Or investing in lead abatement, right? That’s going to maybe reduce homicides 15 years from now, but it’s not going to be compelling to the community that is struggling right now.That, to me, was the biggest problem with the argument that we should just be shifting money from police to these other things. I think there’s lots of evidence that we should also be investing in these other things. So summer jobs for teens is one big example—lots of evidence that that reduces violent crime, not just during the summer, when people are working, but after the fact. Lead abatement, as I said, we’re looking at stuff like—there’s evidence that real-time exposure to air pollution can affect violence—Demsas: I think you tweeted out a study that was just so absurd. It was like, Short-term air pollution increases fatal accidents in real time. Like, air pollution—Doleac: Yeah. It’s crazy. It really makes you wonder or think about all the ways that air-pollution exposure is probably affecting our thinking and reasoning all the time that are not pushing us to commit a crime, right? But that’s a really extreme outcome. But yeah, there’s a study that I love that looks at a highway, and they say, If the wind is blowing the exhaust from the highway to the west one day, violent crime goes up over there. And if the next day it blows the exhaust to the east, violent crime goes up over there. And so it’s just like, Okay, let’s think about putting air filters in all the schools or something.Demsas: Do we have free will, Jennifer Doleac? (Laughs.)Doleac: Right. (Laughs.) Yeah. There’s lots of stuff that we can do that is outside the scope of the traditional criminal-justice system that would dramatically improve public safety. And I am 100 percent in favor of investing in all of those things. I think where it gets tricky, and thinking about the trade-off with policing—or to the extent to which these things are compliments or substitutes for policing—is going to depend on, in large part, what the time horizon is you’re thinking about.And so long term, yeah, it probably will help dramatically, and we probably could shift a lot of our criminal-justice spending from policing, but also especially prisons. I actually think a lot more about prison spending as being the target here, like shifting those resources to these other types of areas.Demsas: You mean shifting away from prison spending?Doleac: Away from prison spending. Right? I think there’s a really good argument here that if we invested in lead abatement, if we invested in summer jobs, if we invested in police, even—investing in, in general, those social investments, but also increasing the probability of getting caught—that’s our ticket out of mass incarceration, is my view.But so we could dramatically, long term, shift that spending to these other things. If we invest in these other things, we would see dividends in terms of reduced prison spending and perhaps also a reduced necessity for police spending. But in any given moment—I mean, even Norway has police, right? I don’t see a world where, because we’ve invested so fully in mental health and education and all the rest, there’s just no crime anymore. I think there’s always going to be crime, and I think there’s always going to be a need for police, but I think there are a lot of things we could do to reduce people’s propensity to commit crime.Demsas: So what are the ways that, when you’re reviewing literature here, you can actually reduce the negative externalities of policing, particularly when we’re talking about not just the most, you know, I think, well-known instances of police brutality that end in murder, but also ones where, I mean, often, when you have this pretty prevalent policing—foot policing, foot traffic, hotspot policing—it often means that there’s low-level harassment of people going on in that community.And you know, whether you call that harassment or you call that, you know, police are just checking in, like, What are you up to? What are you doing? I mean, you can characterize it how you want. But anyone who’s interacted with a police officer in a way where you’re being questioned about your daily life and goings-on—it can be kind of stressful.It can also make you feel like you’re being watched and make you feel like you’re doing something wrong, like you’re not supposed to be there. Often, they will just tell you to keep it moving or go somewhere else or do something different, even if you’re not breaking the law, and you need to just comply in order to not escalate the situation.So these sorts of things can be costly upon a population of people, even if it’s reducing crime rates overall. So are there ways of reducing that cost on society, or is that just a necessary part of what policing looks like?Doleac: I am very hopeful that it’s not a necessary part of what policing looks like. So I think this is a place that police departments are experimenting. Researchers are eager to test what different places are doing.There is an ongoing randomized trial of—basically a follow up to a previous RCT—procedural-justice training for police, so basically trying to train officers to think of the end goal of any interaction, that everyone involved to feel like they respect the outcome, even if they disagree with it. And so the intervention is largely around changing how police officers interact with their bosses in the department. So the boss sort of models this procedural-justice interaction for them, and then the idea is that they’ll go on and do that out in communities.And so there was an RCT several years ago in Seattle of this training, and it was on the small side, which is why they’re following up and doing another larger-scale RCT. But it did seem to reduce—I believe it looked at—use of force and some other bad things, and so generally seemed positive and seemed to have beneficial impacts. And so we’ll see in this larger multicity RCT if it continues to work.Another type of training that seems to be effective and that I’m eager to see replications of elsewhere is a situational decision-making training that was developed by some researchers in Chicago in partnership with the police department that’s based on cognitive behavioral therapy. So basically helping police officers—like anyone else in a high-risk, high-speed, high-pressure environment—avoid what they call “thinking traps,” and avoid jumping to conclusions, and just think about all the different options. And that seemed to reduce use of force, reduce arrests, and also reduce injuries of officers, so win-win all around. And so there are a bunch of other trainings like that that I think are being tried and just to just see what happens.I also think, you know, there are probably a lot of people that just should not be police officers, right? If you’re not cool under pressure, like, this is probably not the job for you. So my hunch is that a lot of the police killings that we see, especially the ones that make the news, I think a lot of them really are that, you know, the cop was genuinely afraid in the moment—not all of them, certainly, but, like, a large share. But if you’re that afraid in the moment, you probably shouldn’t have a gun.So there’s some combination here of training that could be effective, and we’ll figure that out, and then there’s probably an element of screening in terms of, like, Who should we be hiring? Who should we retain? How do we make sure that departments have the ability to discipline people when they do something wrong? But also just have the tough conversation with someone and say, You’re not a fit for this job anymore. You’re fired. So I think it’ll be a combination of those things, but I’m hopeful to see that go forward.Another bucket of potential interventions here that we haven’t talked about is technology.Demsas: Speeding cameras. Right.Doleac: And so, you know, I’ve thought a lot about, you know—it’s like putting surveillance cameras everywhere. Like, we could be like London, right, and have cameras everywhere. I’ve done research on DNA databases where people who are convicted of crimes, sometimes arrested for certain crimes, are added to a law-enforcement DNA database, which increases the probability that they’ll get caught if they commit another crime. And for all these kinds of interventions, you see a huge deterrent effect afterwards. People respond to that increased probability of getting caught.Now, people worry, then, about privacy costs, but I think there’s a real conversation to be had about whether the privacy cost of having a camera on every street corner is really worse than the social cost of having a police officer on every corner. I think there are a lot of communities that would probably prefer the camera, and it could have the same sort of effect.And so anyway, I think there’s a lot of opportunity here to just experiment with some different ways forward. And I think this is where all of the research and policy attention is in this space right now, is trying new things on these dimensions.Demsas: Yeah, I’ve been surprised at the conversation regarding traffic violations and cameras because, I mean, when you look at the research, you can basically eliminate racial disparities in traffic violations. If you turn it over to just automated cameras, Were you going over the speed limit? But they’re so unpopular, obviously. People do not like to use cameras. Someone once said to me, like, No, I want the cop to catch me. Doleac: (Laughs.) That’s funny. I mean, my general very cynical interpretation of that is that, you know, the main way that disparities come about is that police use their discretion in favor of, or to let the favored group off the hook. And so lots of white people are used to talking their way out of tickets, and you can’t talk your way out of a ticket from a speed camera, and so they don’t like it. But it is fair.Demsas: Yeah. There’s also a bizarre argument that some people use, which is just that there’s a racially disproportionate effect, because in places where there are highways, people are often going into minority neighborhoods because they’re placed near highways in less-desirable locations. And as a result, you might have more people who are Black and brown being caught by these cameras. And I’m like, Yeah, but that means those people are speeding through Black and brown communities. That’s who’s getting impacted by the speeding and getting pedestrian deaths and things like that. Like, that’s the whole argument.Doleac: Right. You’re trying to protect people in that community. And also, I mean, yeah. Exactly. It’s like, if you’re really worried about that, then put more cameras in the white communities. Just, I mean—just the answer to me seems to be more, not fewer.Demsas: And so, you know, there’s been a renewed interest in broken-windows policing, and I’m interested in your thoughts on the relationship between order-maintenance policing and, you know, violent crime. I think many people kind of think, like, I want cops to reduce murders. We don’t want more murders. We don’t want assaults. We don’t want sexual assault. Like, those sorts of things are really, really harmful.And I went back to the 1982 Atlantic article that I think is the genesis of the broken-windows policing in the public discourse, and there’s a passage that describes what this sort of thing looks like that I’m just going to read. And I want you to tell me whether you think that this sort of order-maintenance policing is really important for reducing crime. So it reads,The officer—call him Kelly—knew who the regulars were, and they knew him. As he saw his job, he was to keep an eye on strangers, and make certain that the disreputable regulars observed some informal but widely understood rules. Drunks and addicts could sit on the stoops, but could not lie down. People could drink on side streets, but not at the main intersection. Bottles had to be in paper bags. Talking to, bothering, or begging from people waiting at the bus stop was strictly forbidden. If a dispute erupted between a businessman and a customer, the businessman was assumed to be right, especially if the customer was a stranger. If a stranger loitered, Kelly would ask him if he had any means of support and what his business was; if he gave unsatisfactory answers, he was sent on his way. Persons who broke the informal rules, especially those who bothered people waiting at bus stops, were arrested for vagrancy. Noisy teenagers were told to keep quiet.So almost none of these are laws. You know what I mean? Or some of these might be laws, but they’re not even being really enforced. Like, you’re not allowed to drink in public. It doesn’t matter if it’s in a paper bag or not. The idea that, like, lying down is somehow different for loitering than sitting up—I don’t know if that’s written in any codes or anything like that.But there is a sense in which I think a lot of people feel like there’s a general social disorder that they’re frustrated by and mad about, particularly in many cities. And I wonder: How much of policing is about this type of order maintenance, and what relationship does that order-maintenance policing have to do with the violent-crime rates that everyone’s concerned about?Doleac: This is a really tough question. I agree—it is one that is on everyone’s mind right now. My general sense is that this type of order maintenance is not directly related to crimes like homicide. I haven’t seen great evidence on that, though, so I could definitely be wrong about that. We do have growing evidence that the kind of low-level arrests—like arresting more people for disorderly conduct or using drugs in public or whatever else—that does not reduce index crimes, the more serious crimes. And so, you know, people are finding various natural experiments that affect the number of those low-level arrests that police make and that they don’t seem to be helpful for reducing more serious crime.That said, this broader type of disorder matters and definitely makes people feel unsafe and can contribute to a broader kind of vicious cycle where, you know, people just stay home, and then you have fewer eyes on the street, as Jane Jacobs said. And then that can increase crime. And so there is a way in which it can matter in the long term. But it also matters in the short term because it just makes people feel unsafe, even if they themselves are at relatively low risk of being the victim of a crime.And so, I mean, my team at AV has an advocacy component. And they all came back from this spring’s legislative session saying, you know, We had all these great ideas about how to reduce crime, and the only thing anyone wants to talk about is disorder. What do we do about disorder? And I think, in general, the research consensus is: We don’t want to go back to broken-windows policing.The conventional wisdom had been that that’s why crime fell in New York City. But that was during the early to mid to late ’90s, and crime fell everywhere. So it wasn’t just New York City. It wasn’t just broken windows. And so the consensus, I think, in the research literature is that broken-windows policing is not really helpful, in part because communities need to trust the police in order to cooperate with them.But all of that said, I think we’re in a period right now where we are reconsidering the ways we’ve handled disorder. I think the pendulum had swung a little too far toward leniency, you know, especially pre-COVID, due to that big crime decline and really ambitious criminal-justice reform. I think a lot of people were saying, Look—we don’t need any of this. Everything’s great. And as the pendulum swung too far left, people responded, and we got more of this disorderly behavior that makes people really uncomfortable.And so my hope is that we don’t swing all the way back to super “tough on crime.” But I think we just—we’d gone too far. And so we need to kind of find some middle ground, but we are definitely in a period of experimentation right now to figure out what some new answers will be.Demsas: Well, Jennifer, that’s a great place for our final question, which is: What is something you once thought was a good idea but ended up just being good on paper?Doleac: I love this question. So many things—I’ve tried so many things that didn’t work. But the first example that comes to mind is totally different from anything we’ve talked about, which is: Several years ago—I grew up with dogs, always wanted to have a dog, was finally at a place in my adult life where I was like, I’m ready to get a dog. And then I fostered a very sweet pit bull mix.Demsas: Okay.Doleac: And suddenly realized that it completely changed my life in ways that I was unprepared for.Demsas: Oh, interesting.Doleac: I was an academic. I got up every morning, was just in my head, like, to wander the coffee shop, spend most of the day there. And suddenly, I had this creature in my house that needed to be fed and watered and walked, and needed me around.Demsas: Yeah.Doleac: And it made me really sad how poorly this was going. And eventually, I decided this is just not going to work. And I had to give the dog back. And it was heartbreaking. But fast-forward to during COVID, and I was like, I need something, anything to think about other than work and Netflix. I know! I’ll get a dog. I remember how much work that is. And so then I adopted my adorable rescue pup, Chula, who is now an integral part of my life. So the revised version of the plan has been going very well. But yeah, the first version was definitely good on paper only.Demsas: Well, Jennifer, thank you so much for coming on the show. This was fantastic.Doleac: Oh, thank you so much.

Tell him about your lifelong or in-the-moment problems at dearjames@theatlantic.com.Don’t want to miss a single column? Sign up to get “Dear James” in your inbox.Dear James,I’ve never been an anxious person. However, since the election, I’ve been experiencing what I imagine are anxiety attacks. (I initially went down a cardiology rabbit hole, as I’m told is common for your first time, but ultimately landed on circumstantially triggered panic.) Cutting to the chase: I’ve realized I’m no longer feeling enraged or even hopeless but instead I am fearful … of Men. This is a difficult state of cognitive dissonance to be in, given that I have a lovely and kind husband and a young son who epitomizes the term mama’s boy, and I have luckily never experienced a traumatic event that would trigger these vague but crippling thoughts. So how do I separate my fear of Men (capital M) from my love of men (lowercase m)? I’m asking you in particular because your name is James, and because you seem to have the wise, fatherly vibe I need from a person who might tell me the truth without making me spiral.Dear Reader,Well, I’ve had a few panic attacks, and I’m also a man, so let’s see if I can be of any use to you.Once upon a time, in some dank, forgotten venue in London, I saw the spoken-word performer Don Bajema opening for Rollins Band. (Those were the days: You heard some poetry and then you got flattened by some rock and roll.) The line of Bajema’s that fixed itself in my memory—the line with which, as I recall, he ended his set—went something like this: So what can I do, what can I do but try like fucking hell to be a man?It took a few years, and some belated growing up, before I understood why I’d hung on to these words in particular: because they prophesied my own basic sense of manhood. Being a man—a realized man, a non-chaotic man—is something (I learned) that you have to work at. You have to try like fucking hell, and keep trying. A man’s sense of himself, like a dodgy website, is always under construction. For as long as he lives, there’ll be something provisional and precarious about it—which can lead, if unacknowledged, to all sorts of trouble, usually for the women and the children in his life. But a man who’s carrying his own weight, who knows his own frailty and can manage it, will give a woman or a child no reason to be afraid.Having said all that, I’m as reluctant to talk about uppercase-M Men as I am to talk about uppercase-W Women, for the simple reason that I don’t know any. All of my friends and loved ones—men, women, and nonbinary—live in lowercase, trying hard, screwing up, doing their best, falling short, hurting people, delighting people: the standard human comedy. They’re not mouthing off on podcasts or writing hot takes. They’re people, not pundits or politicians. I know that the incoming wave of Trumpism bears with it a foaming mantle of boors and braggarts and shouty ideologues, all carrying on with apparent impunity. But that is just so much noise. It really is. It will pass. Don’t let them get in your head.Anxiety loves an abstraction, some big zero of a concept that it can chew on infinitely. A free-floating Fear of Men, like a Fear of Death or a Fear of Insanity, is ideal food for Johnny Panic (as Sylvia Plath called him—in The Atlantic, as it happens, back in 1968). It’s tiramisu to him. So cut him off. Get down in your own life and talk with your own men: That’s the level at which to conduct the grand negotiation between the sexes, which is always evolving and which will evolve (I’m assuming) forever.My own panic attacks, as I now see them, were a primer in ontological instability—for which, in retrospect, I’m grateful: Knowing how close we all are to the Howling Nothing, that’s good stuff for a writer, good stuff for a human being. At the time, however, it was bloody awful. For you, in the thick of it right now, I prescribe deep breathing, cold showers, reduced caffeine, repeated viewings of What About Bob?, and a session or two with Walker Percy’s Lost in the Cosmos.One foot in front of the other,JamesBy submitting a letter, you are agreeing to let The Atlantic use it in part or in full, and we may edit it for length and/or clarity.​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

    "title": "The End of Democratic Delusions",
    "author": "George Packer",
    "date": "December 2, 2024",
    "text": "The Roosevelt Republic—the progressive age that extended social welfare and equal rights to a widening circle of Americans—endured from the 1930s to the 1970s. At the end of that decade, it was overthrown by the Reagan Revolution, which expanded individual liberties on the strength of a conservative free-market ideology, until it in turn crashed against the 2008 financial crisis. The era that followed has lacked a convincing name and a clear identity. It’s been variously called the post–post–Cold War, post-neoliberalism, the Great Awokening, and the Great Stagnation. But the 2024 election has shown that the dominant political figure of this period is Donald Trump, who, by the end of his second term, will have loomed over American life for as long as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s dozen years as president. We are living in the Trump Reaction. By the standard of its predecessors, we’re still at the beginning.This new era is neither progressive nor conservative. The organizing principle in Trump’s chaotic campaigns, the animating passion among his supporters, has been a reactionary turn against dizzying change, specifically the economic and cultural transformations of the past half century: the globalization of trade and migration, the transition from an industrial to an information economy, the growing inequality between metropolis and hinterland, the end of the traditional family, the rise of previously disenfranchised groups, the “browning” of the American people. Trump’s basic appeal is a vow to take power away from the elites and invaders who have imposed these changes and return the country to its rightful owners—the real Americans. His victory demonstrated the appeal’s breadth in blue and red states alike, among all ages, ethnicities, and races.For two and a half centuries American politics alternated between progressive and conservative periods, played between the 40-yard lines of liberal democracy. The values of freedom, equality, and rule of law at least received lip service; the founding documents enjoyed the status of civic scripture; the requisite American mood was optimism. Although reaction has dominated local or regional (mainly southern) politics, it’s something new in our national politics—which explains why Trump has been misunderstood and written off at every turn. Reaction is insular and aggrieved, and it paints in dark tones. It wants to undo progress and reverse history, restoring the nation to some imagined golden age when the people ruled. They want a strongman with the stomach to trample on the liberal pieties of the elites who sold them out.This is why so many voters are willing to tolerate—in some cases, celebrate—Trump’s vile language and behavior; his love affairs with foreign dictators; his readiness to toss aside norms, laws, the Constitution itself. Asked by pollsters if they’re concerned about the state of democracy, these voters answer yes—not because they fear its demise, but because it has already failed them. They don’t think Trump will destroy democracy; he’ll restore it to the people.The triumph of the Trump Reaction should put an end to two progressive illusions that have considerably strengthened it. One is the notion that identity is political destiny. For a long time, the Democratic Party regarded demographic change in America, the coming “minority majority,” as a consoling promise during interim Republican victories: As the country turned less white, it would inevitably turn more blue. In the past decade this notion was absorbed into an ideological framework that became the pervasive worldview of progressives—a metaphysics of group identity in which a generalized “people of color” (adjusted during the social-justice revolution of 2020 to “BIPOC”) were assumed to share a common experience of oppression that would determine their collective political behavior, driving them far to the left on issues such as immigration, policing, and transgender rights.The 2024 election exploded this illusion. Nearly half of Latinos and a quarter of Black men voted for Trump. In New York City he did better in Queens and the Bronx, which have majority nonwhite populations, than in Manhattan, with its plurality of wealthy white people. M. Gessen of The New York Times called it “not a good night for solidarity,” but the presumption of like-mindedness among immensely diverse groups of voters should be retired, along with the term people of color, which has lost any usefulness for political analysis.Adjacent to the demographic illusion is a majoritarian one. By this theory, the Democratic Party is kept out of power by a white Republican minority that thwarts the popular will through voter suppression, gerrymandering, judicial legislating, the filibuster, the composition of the Senate, and the Electoral College. By this thinking, the ultimate obstacle to the American promise is the Constitution itself. The United States needs to become less republican and more democratic, with electoral reforms and perhaps a second constitutional convention to give more power to the people. This analysis contains some undeniable truths—the public’s voice is thwarted by structural barriers, partisan machinations, and enormous quantities of plutocratic cash. As long as Republican presidents continued to lose the popular vote, the majoritarian argument was tempting, even if its advocates ignored the likelihood that a new constitution would turn out to be less democratic than the old one.But every election is a reminder that the country is narrowly divided and has been for decades, with frequent changes of control in the House of Representatives. Now that Trump has won the popular vote and the Electoral College, the majoritarian illusion, like the demographic one, should be seen for what it is: an impediment to Democratic success. It relieved the party of the need to listen and persuade rather than expecting the dei ex machina of population and rule changes to do the work of politics.When Democrats lose a presidential election, they descend into a familiar quarrel over whether the party moved too far to the left or to the center. This time the question seems especially irrelevant; their political problem runs so much deeper. The Democratic Party finds itself on the wrong side of a historic swing toward right-wing populism, and tactical repositioning won’t help. The mood in America, as in electorates all over the world, is profoundly anti-establishment. Trump had a mass movement behind him; Kamala Harris was installed by party elites. He offered disruption, chaos, and contempt; she offered a tax break for small businesses. He spoke for the alienated; she spoke for the status quo.Democrats have become the party of institutionalists. Much of their base is metropolitan, credentialed, economically comfortable, and pro-government. A realignment has been going on since the early ’70s: Democrats now claim the former Republican base of college-educated professionals, and Republicans have replaced Democrats as the party of the working class. As long as globalization, technology, and immigration were widely seen as not only inevitable but positive forces, the Democratic Party appeared to ride the wave of history, while Republicans depended on a shrinking pool of older white voters in dying towns. But something profound changed around 2008.I spent the years after the financial crisis reporting in parts of the country that were being ravaged by the Great Recession and the long decline that had preceded it, and were growing hostile toward the country’s first Black president. Three things recurred everywhere I went: a conviction that the political and economic game was rigged for the benefit of distant elites; a sense that the middle class had disappeared; and the absence of any institutions that might have provided help, including the Democratic Party. It was hard to miss the broken landscape that lay open for Trump, but the establishments of both parties didn’t see it, and neither did most of the media, which had lost touch with the working class. The morning after Trump’s shocking victory in 2016, a colleague approached me angrily and said, “Those were your people, and you empowered them by making other people feel sorry for them—and it was wrong!”In some ways, the Biden administration and the Harris campaign tried to reorient the Democratic Party back toward the working class, which was once its backbone. Biden pursued policies and passed legislation to create jobs that don’t require a college degree in communities that have been left behind. Harris studiously avoided campaigning on her identity as a Black and South Asian woman, appealing instead to a vague sense of patriotism and hope. But Biden’s industrial policy didn’t produce results fast enough to offset the damage of inflation—no one I talked with in Maricopa County, Arizona, or Washington County, Pennsylvania, this year seemed to have heard of the Inflation Reduction Act. Harris remained something of a cipher because of Biden’s stubborn refusal to step aside until it was too late for her or anyone else to make their case to Democratic voters. The party’s economic policies turned populist, but its structure—unlike the Republican Party’s mass cult of personality—appeared to be a glittering shell of power brokers and celebrities around a hollow core. Rebuilding will be the work of years, and realignment could take decades.So much of the Trump Reaction’s triumph is unfair. It’s unfair that a degenerate man has twice beaten a decent, capable woman. It’s unfair that Harris graciously conceded defeat, whereas Trump, in her position, would once again have kick-started the machinery of lies that he built on his own behalf, continuing to undermine trust in democracy for years to come. It’s unfair that most of the media immediately moved on from Trump’s hateful rhetoric and threats of violence against migrants and political opponents. His campaign was unforgivable—but in the words of W. H. Auden’s poem “Spain,” “History to the defeated / May say Alas but cannot help or pardon.”The Trump Reaction is more fragile than it now seems. Trump’s behavior in the last weeks of the campaign did not augur a coherent second presidency. He will surround himself with ideologues, opportunists, and crackpots, and because he has no interest in governing, they will try to fill the vacuum and turn on one another. The Trump administration, with a favorable Congress, will overreach on issues such as abortion and immigration, soon alienating important parts of its new coalition. It will enact economic policies that favor the party’s old allies among the rich at the expense of its new supporters among the less well-off. It’s quite possible that, approaching 80, Trump will find himself once more among the least popular presidents in the country’s history. But in the meantime, he will have enormous latitude to abuse his power for enrichment and revenge, and to shred the remaining ties that bind Americans to one another, and the country to democracies around the world.The Trump Reaction will test opponents with a difficult balancing act, one that recalls F. Scott Fitzgerald’s famous line about a first-rate intelligence holding two opposed ideas in mind while still being able to function. The Democratic Party has to undertake the necessary self-scrutiny that starts with the errors of Biden, Harris, and their inner circle, but that extends to the party’s long drift away from the most pressing concerns of ordinary Americans, toward the eccentric obsessions of its donors and activists. But this examination can’t end in paralysis, because at the same time, the opposition will have to act. Much of this action will involve civil society and the private sector along with surviving government institutions—to prevent by legal means the mass internment and deportation of migrants from communities in which they’ve been peacefully living for years; to save women whose lives are threatened by laws that would punish them for trying to save themselves; to protect the public health from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s security from Tulsi Gabbard, and its coffers from Elon Musk.Journalists will have a special challenge in the era of the Trump Reaction. We’re living in a world where facts instantly perish upon contact with human minds. Local news is disappearing, and a much-depleted national press can barely compete with the media platforms of billionaires who control users algorithmically, with an endless stream of conspiracy theories and deepfakes. The internet, which promised to give everyone information and a voice, has consolidated in just a few hands the power to destroy the very notion of objective truth. “Legacy journalism is dead,” Musk crowed on his own X in the week before the election. Instead of chasing phantoms on social media, journalists would make better use of our dwindling resources, and perhaps regain some of the public’s trust, by doing what we’ve done in every age: expose the lies and graft of oligarchs and plutocrats, and tell the stories of people who can’t speak for themselves.A few weeks before the election, Representative Chris Deluzio, a first-term Democrat, was campaigning door-to-door in a closely divided district in western Pennsylvania. He’s a Navy veteran, a moderate on cultural issues, and a homegrown economic populist—critical of corporations, deep-pocketed donors, and the ideology that privileges capital over human beings and communities. At one house he spoke with a middle-aged white policeman named Mike, who had a Trump sign in his front yard. Without budging on his choice for president, Mike ended up voting for Deluzio. On Election Night, in a state carried by Trump, Deluzio outperformed Harris in his district, especially in the reddest areas, and won comfortably. What does this prove? Only that politics is best when it’s face-to-face and based on respect, that most people are complicated and even persuadable, and that—in the next line from the Fitzgerald quote—one can “see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise.”This article appears in the January 2025 print edition with the headline “The End of Democratic Delusions.”",

    "title": "The Christian Case for Happy Holidays",
    "author": "Elizabeth Bruenig",
    "date": "December 2, 2024",
    "text": "Toward the end of his second campaign for president, Donald Trump promised a weary nation one thing: “Merry Christmas” is coming back. “We’re going to have ‘Merry Christmas,’ just like we got for everybody seven years ago, [when] we brought it back,” Trump declared in a Facebook video. “It was in deep trouble, [but] we brought it back.”“Merry Christmas” was never in real danger, of course, but the complaint comes from conservative Christians who bemoan the diminishment of public Christian sentiment. This contingent is most displeased with the loss of explicit Christian dominance in culture—the fact that, for example, department stores and restaurants have, in recent decades, replaced Christmas decorations with nonspecific holiday decorations, or changed special Christmas menus to special holiday menus. (Despite his crusade for Christmas, Trump’s own stores, buildings, and restaurants do not generally refer to Christmas.) In the logic of this grievance, “Merry Christmas” is pitted against “Happy holidays” in a competition for the nation’s character.But the dichotomy is misbegotten, and there are plenty of reasons even devoutly conservative Christians should consider wishing others “Happy holidays” this season. This isn’t to say that using “Merry Christmas” is a bad thing to do—it isn’t, especially when speaking with coreligionists or on Christmas Day itself. And though I doubt that most people are so sensitive as to take offense at a well-intended salutation, “Happy holidays” still has a great deal to recommend it.To begin with, there are, in fact, other holidays at the end of the year—not just of other faiths but also within Christianity. The word holiday ought not be confined in meaning to bank holidays—why should financial institutions or governments dictate what constitutes a true holiday?—but rather to the original sense of holy days. Christmas is certainly an important holy day, but so are the days of Advent, the prayerful, anticipatory weeks leading up to the grand finale. And so, too, is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception—a major event in the Catholic calendar and a “holy day of obligation,” meaning that Catholics must report to Mass to observe it. (In Nicaragua, Spain, the Philippines, and many other countries, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception is a national holiday, in the secular sense.) For that reason, “Happy holidays,” being plural and inclusive, captures a genuinely pious—Christian—sentiment.These holidays are, admittedly, quite High Church. But there are other, more ecumenical Christian reasons for keeping “Happy holidays” on hand. Take Hanukkah, which this year begins on Christmas Day: The celebration of God’s miracle of lights originates in the Books of the Maccabees, which are considered canonical by the majority of Christians, and Jesus himself celebrates the occasion in the Book of John. This is perhaps why certain Christians do observe the festival, and why Orthodox Christians use menorahs in their churches. Again, considering the multiplicity of conservative Christian-friendly holidays at the end of the year, Christians have no reason to eschew more inclusive tidings.More important is the fact that a friendly greeting is a kind of charity—a most Christian virtue. Such a greeting constitutes an offer of hope for another’s happiness, which means it is done primarily for the benefit of the other person, not for the speaker themselves. In that case, the well wishes should be addressed in the broadest possible terms—if you don’t know what someone might celebrate but intend to greet them warmly, it doesn’t make sense to pinpoint one specific tradition as the means of your connection. To wish someone well only in the sense that matters to you without regard for what matters to them is to defeat the purpose of wishing someone well in the first place.But perhaps the militant wing of “Merry Christmas” wishers derives a little pleasure in intentionally slighting members of other religions, or people who might not celebrate anything specific at all. It’s a small act of illiberalism—not so much an opportunity for connection with others as a chance to make a point about which religion ought to dominate American life. The “Merry Christmas” anger intimates a certain discontent with a pluralistic America. I certainly have concerns about the liberal tradition, but one thing liberalism does well is helping cool tensions among hostile religious sects (indeed, this is part of the typical origin story of liberalism). The result of this effect is something we should prize: peace among people of widely varied beliefs with conflicting truth claims. Maintaining that accord requires tolerance and generosity, which aren’t always easy virtues. But it’s worth a number of small concessions to sleep in heavenly peace.",

    "title": "America Stopped Cooking With Tallow for a Reason",
    "author": "Yasmin Tayag",
    "date": "December 2, 2024",
    "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s latest spin on MAGA, “Make frying oil tallow again,” is surprisingly straightforward for a man who has spent decades downplaying his most controversial opinions. Last month, Kennedy argued in an Instagram post that Americans were healthier when restaurants such as McDonald’s cooked fries in beef tallow—that is, cow fat—instead of seed oils, a catchall term for common vegetable-derived oils including corn, canola, and sunflower. Americans, he wrote, are “being unknowingly poisoned” by seed oils; in his view, we’d all be better off cooking with solid fats such as tallow, butter, and lard. In a video that Kennedy posted on Thanksgiving, he deep-fries a whole turkey in beef tallow and says, “This is how we cook the MAHA way.”Cardiologists shuddered at the thought. Conventional medical guidance has long recommended the reverse: less solid fat, more plant oils. But in recent years, a fringe theory has gained prominence for arguing that seed oils are toxic, put into food by a nefarious elite—including Big Pharma, the FDA, and food manufacturers—to keep Americans unhealthy and dependent. Most nutrition scientists squarely dismiss this idea as a conspiracy theory. But the movement probes some unresolved, fundamental questions about nutrition. Are saturated fatty acids—the kind in animal fat—actually dangerous? And are polyunsaturated ones—found in plant-derived oils—really all that great for your heart? The fact that these debates remain unsettled does not validate Kennedy’s view on fats, which represents a complete reversal of conventional health beliefs. But it does leave plenty of room for his philosophy to proliferate.When McDonald’s started using beef tallow in the 1950s, relatively little was known about the relationship between fat and heart health. Tallow was used because it was cheap and tasty. Previous animal studies had already hinted at a link between fat intake and heart disease. Subsequent research on humans pegged the correlation to saturated fat, which comes from animals and is typically solid at room temperature. In contrast, polyunsaturated fat, which is derived from plants and is generally liquid at room temperature, was found to reduce levels of the “bad” LDL cholesterol associated with increased risk of heart disease. By the 1970s, a large body of research had demonstrated that the typical American diet, high in saturated fat and cholesterol, was associated with a high risk of heart disease. The first U.S. dietary guidelines, released in 1980, recommended reducing total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. (They also advocated for eating more carbohydrates, which backfired.) In 1988, a Nebraska-based businessman launched a passionate nationwide crusade calling on McDonald’s to end its use of tallow and stop its “poisoning of America.” (This rhetoric, like Kennedy’s, is an exaggeration, but at least it was rooted in reality.) In 1990, McDonald’s switched to 100 percent vegetable oil, as did chains such as Wendy’s and Burger King.The shift from saturated to polyunsaturated fats—not just in restaurants but in home kitchens—corresponded with major health gains in the United States. In 1962, Americans began to consume more vegetable fats, largely in the form of margarine; four years later, cardiovascular deaths began a decades-long decline. From 1940 to 1996, deaths from heart disease fell by 56 percent, and they continued falling through 2013, albeit at a lower rate. Although the decline can be partly attributed to factors such as better blood-pressure control and lower rates of smoking, “the increase in polyunsaturated fat is probably one of the primary factors, if not the primary factor, in dramatically reducing heart-disease death” as well as lowering the risk of diabetes, dementia, and total mortality, Walter Willett, a Harvard professor of nutrition and epidemiology, told me.The research has continued to bear out the dangers of saturated fats—and, crucially, the benefits of replacing them with polyunsaturated ones. The most recent version of the U.S. dietary guidelines caps saturated fat intake at roughly 20 grams a day. Federal guidance holds that “the best way to protect your health is not just to limit saturated fat—it’s to replace it with healthier unsaturated fats.” That is to say, no one should be replacing their seed oils with beef tallow.The arguments in favor of saturated fats can largely be split into three categories. The first questions the validity of the research that established the harms of saturated fats. Two commonly cited meta-analyses—studies of existing studies—published in 2010 and 2014 concluded that the evidence for consuming less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fat was inconclusive. Both stoked fiery debates and rigorous scrutiny. A correction to the 2014 study essentially nullified its findings. Neither study accounted for what people ate in place of saturated fat. More to the point, the authors of these studies questioned the existing consensus on dietary fats—but did not call for the total elimination of seed oils from the American diet.The second category alleges the harms of seed oil. Some tallow truthers claim that consuming too much omega-6, a polyunsaturated fatty acid commonly found in seed oils, allows it to outcompete its more healthful cousin, omega-3, which is found in nuts and fish. But, according to Willett, the body’s regulatory mechanisms prevent such imbalances, and viewing individual fatty acids as competitors is “an extreme oversimplification of what actually goes on in our metabolic system.” The physician Catherine Shanahan’s book Dark Calories, an exhaustive account of the arguments against seed oil, posits that polyunsaturated seed oils promote oxidative stress, which drives all disease. When I asked Shanahan, popularly known as Dr. Cate, why this was not reflected in the existing scientific literature, she questioned its credibility. “They haven’t seen all the data,” she told me. “They’ve only seen what we’ve been fed.” Another popular wellness influencer known as Carnivore Aurelius, who advocates for an all-meat diet, has claimed without evidence that seed oils are “toxic sludge” that disrupts the functioning of mitochondria.The third category, which is perhaps the most puzzling, comprises a bona fide enthusiasm for tallow—which, to be fair, makes a delicious french fry. Tallow, according to certain corners of the internet, can drive weight loss, boost the immune system, and improve cognition. (No substantial evidence exists to support any of these claims.) Americans aren’t just eating beef tallow—they’re also smearing it on their faces as a supposedly natural alternative to conventional moisturizer, despite a lack of scientific evidence, and, sometimes, the faint smell of cow.The crux of the anti-seed-oil, pro-tallow position is a belief that the medical consensus on dietary fats is compromised by financial interests—of the seed-oil and medical industries, of universities, of the government. Suspicion of corporate interests is central to Kennedy’s views on health in general. His campaign to “Make America healthy again” is rooted in stamping out corruption in government health agencies. As I wrote previously, this anti-establishment attitude resonates throughout the wellness space: among seed-oil truthers, sure, but also proponents of raw milk, carnivorism, and alternative nutrition in general. Arguments for these dietary choices have been endlessly debunked by mainstream scientists and journalists. But such corrections will hold little sway over people who fundamentally distrust the data they are based on.For Kennedy and his supporters, the science isn’t really the point—bucking convention is. Rejecting the consensus about saturated fats makes a political statement. (As a bonus, it creates a market for Make Frying Oil Tallow Again crop tops, trucker caps, and dog bandanas.) But as far as scientists can tell, it’s not going to make anyone healthier. Between potatoes deep-fried in tallow or in seed oils, the latter is “for sure better,” Willett said. Still, no matter your political stance, no french fry is ever going to be healthy.",

    "title": "Would You Pay $1,000 for a Family Photo?",
    "author": "Erin Sagen",
    "date": "December 2, 2024",
    "text": "Updated at 4:07 p.m. ET on December 2, 2024Kirsten Bethmann started photographing families in 2005. She was living in the Outer Banks, in North Carolina, and found the era’s default aesthetic to be pretty uninspired—“families standing stiffly in sand dunes,” as she described it to me. So, when she entered the field, she drew from her background in photojournalism and tried something more natural: She’d instruct families to play on the beach for most of their hour-long session, then spend 10 minutes taking traditional, posed photos. She even drafted contracts making clients swear they wouldn’t show up in matching outfits or dress head to toe in khaki and white.The first year, she had a dozen customers. Twenty years later, her services are in such high demand that some people fly her out of the state, even out of the country, and shell out $7,000 for a day-long shoot.At a time when nearly anyone can easily take a high-quality photo with their smartphone, you might assume that people like Bethmann would be struggling to find work. But the number of working professional photographers has actually grown about 15 percent in the past decade, according to Census Bureau data, and is expected to keep rising. Family photography is one of the field’s most popular specialties. Rates as steep as Bethmann’s are uncommon. Only 3 percent of families who get their picture taken pay more than $4,000, a report by the Professional Photographers of America found, and more than a third pay less than $500. Still, a lot of people spend more than you might realize: Nearly 40 percent of customers dish out more than $1,000 for a shoot.Putting so much money toward professional photos may seem extravagant. But family pictures have, of course, long been highly valued heirlooms. The impulse to hold on to a memory is almost primal—think of ancestors drawing on cave walls or telling stories around a fire. Today, that age-old instinct of preservation is colliding with new pressures from social media for people to measure up to what they see online, propelling demand and transforming how and why families capture their memories: what the photos look like, what they cost, and, crucially, who they are for.For thousands of years, only elites could afford portraits of their loved ones. But in the early 1800s, the invention of the camera gradually opened up that luxury to the middle class, especially as a way to memorialize important family moments, even deaths. By the end of the century, pictures had become as fundamental a wedding ritual as saying “I do,” Alex Alberro, an art-history professor at Columbia, told me. They served as “a certification” of what had happened. In the decades that followed, independent portrait studios began to pop up around the country, letting families capture less significant events, too. The photography chain Olan Mills opened its first permanent shop in Arkansas in 1938, and many department stores added studios. Before long, driving to the mall with your family to give your biggest, tightest smiles for a relatively affordable, 15-minute shoot (sometimes in matching outfits) felt like a middle-class custom.Then, in the 1990s, digital cameras revolutionized photography. And in 2007, the iPhone, with its built-in camera, disrupted the market further. If the digital camera dealt an early blow to photo studios by offering a cheaper, more convenient alternative to film, the smartphone’s flexibility supplanted the studio’s rigidity almost entirely. By the mid-2010s, photo studios began closing. Sears and Walmart shut down the last of theirs in 2013. JCPenney still operates about 400, the only remaining department-store photo studios.At the same time as smartphones were shaping how and where families took photos, social media was redefining how they shared those images with others. In the past, pictures were for you and perhaps your family and friends. They might have decorated your walls and filled your albums. “Instagram changed everything,” Karen North, a digital and social-media professor at the University of Southern California and a licensed psychologist, told me. The app gave personal photos a larger audience than ever. Now, across all social-media platforms, hundreds of millions of images are posted every day.The potential dangers of scrolling through so much highly curated imagery are well known. Research has found that the social comparisons it induces can be associated with feelings of anxiety and depression, and that getting likes and comments on your posts can trigger the release of the feel-good chemical dopamine. Professional photographs promise to draw the clicks some people’s brains crave. Mothers, who spend more time than fathers on caregiving and household responsibilities such as scheduling these shoots, may feel outsize pressure to project a perfect image: According to a 2016 study commissioned by Instagram, the average mom checks the app six times a day. And a 2023 CDC report found that most moms who use Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook check them daily. Moms on social media are likely inundated by images of smiling, happy families. Seen in this light, it’s not surprising that they might choose to spend hundreds—if not thousands—of dollars on slick family photos, to keep up with their cousin, their co-worker, anyone with an enviable online life.But families today are eschewing the studio’s timed grins and cringe-inducing poses to instead convey an air of authenticity: a child caught mid-laugh, a parent breastfeeding on the couch. Instagram didn’t completely upend professional photography; it loosened its aesthetic. Now fancy photographers tend to capture families playing in open fields and documenting births in intense detail. The platform is filled with selfies and candid snapshots—or, at least, snapshots that look candid. Blurry pictures carry more social currency than sharp ones, and a too-bright flash imparts a gritty charm that perfect staging cannot. “On social media, photos that get posted are less about polish and precision and more about sharing experiences and telling stories,” Tim Gorichanaz, a Drexel University professor, wrote in The Conversation.All of this imperfection might seem easy enough to capture on an iPhone, but that’s underestimating how sophisticated the average person’s photographic tastes have become. “It’s not just pressing a button,” Jenny Jimenez, a freelance photographer based in Seattle, told me. Photography is a highly technical art; a successful shoot requires the right alchemy of light, location, and weather, not to mention skill in framing, editing, and nurturing trust with your subjects. After 20 years working with families, Jimenez knows the challenges well: teens and spouses who don’t want to be there, controlling parents who quash their children’s natural spontaneity, family members who just won’t let go for a candid shot. She’s learned a few essential lessons, including that kids are usually more comfortable in their own home—and that better pictures come when they’re comfortable. But sometimes the antics still surprise her. Once, when she was with a family at a park, the 9-year-old son spotted two schoolmates standing next to the bridge where the clients were headed to shoot. Humiliated at the prospect of being seen, the son ran off with Jimenez’s camera bag and threatened to throw it over the bridge. (Fortunately, she persuaded him to give it back.)For families who can’t afford upscale pictures, more reasonably priced professional options have emerged. Reporting this article, I learned about Shoott, which operates in more than 60 cities across the U.S. and offers 30-minute, low-cost sessions with freelance photographers in places like a park or public plaza. Families make up about 80 percent of its customers, the CEO and a co-founder, Jennifer Tsay, estimates.Of course, families could also just use their smartphones. But for moms (who, in some families, aren't photographed with their kids very much), for single parents (who don't always have another adult around to take a picture), or for those who just aren’t the self-documenting type, getting some help may make preserving memories easier. Maybe they’ll choose to post the photo on Instagram, or maybe they’ll squirrel it away for future generations—a small but shiny reminder of what it was like to all be together.This article originally stated that the 9-year-old-son of a family that Jenny Jimenez was photographing ran off with her camera. In fact, he ran off with her camera bag.",

    "title": "The Next Abortion Battlefront",
    "author": "Kristen V. Brown",
    "date": "December 3, 2024",
    "text": "Abortion policy in America is at a stalemate. Republicans will take control of Congress in January, ready to block any national protections—but with a slim majority, making a national ban unlikely. At the state level, pro-choice advocates have focused for the past two years on ballot measures to protect abortion rights. Most of those measures have passed; now there are only two states left that have severe restrictions, allow constitutional amendments, and haven’t already failed to pass constitutional protections.Since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, U.S. abortion rates have held steady, or even risen. That’s in part because tens of thousands of women in states with extensive restrictions have ordered the two-pill medication-abortion regimen, mifepristone and misoprostol, by mail. Many thousands more have sought out procedural abortions in states with more lenient rules, and that number may soon begin to rise more steeply. The pills don’t work in every scenario, many women who use them to circumvent restrictions fear being prosecuted, and a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of three conservative states seeks to both outlaw mifepristone for minors and prevent it from being mailed. Project 2025, a blueprint for Donald Trump’s second term created by people with close ties to his incoming administration, outlines a plan to have the FDA pull mifepristone from the market. (Trump himself has flip-flopped repeatedly on whether he might try curbing access to the pill.)Further restrictions on abortion pills could push more women to cross state lines to receive an abortion. That travel can cost thousands of dollars. Since Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a network of so-called practical-support groups has played a growing role booking and funding abortion-related travel. Their work is quieter than the fights in courts and legislatures, but perhaps as crucial to determining the future of abortion in America. As options for major policy changes winnow, this approach is likely to play an even more important role in maintaining access to abortion in the U.S.—and to attract more opposition.  Abortion care, like virtually all medical treatment in America, has always been geographically fractured, with people in poor and rural areas traveling farther to reach services. A study published last month found that people who travel out of state for an abortion are more likely to face expenses that threaten their ability to pay for basic needs. The tighter restrictions get, and the more states put them in place, the greater the distance the average patient must cross, and the greater the average cost of doing so. Practical-support organizations might provide gas money, arrange airport pickups and drop-offs, or even fund the purchase of a winter coat if the travel involves a colder climate. Nancy Davis, a Louisiana resident, sought help from a group called the Brigid Alliance in 2022 when an ultrasound revealed at about 10 weeks that her fetus had acrania, a rare and fatal condition in which the skull does not fully form. Her doctor recommended ending her pregnancy, but abortion had just been banned in Louisiana, so Davis booked an appointment in New York. Brigid took care of the cost of plane tickets, a hotel, and food for Davis and her fiancé, as well as funding child care for her three kids at home. Megan Kovacs, a volunteer and board member with the Northwest Abortion Access Fund, told me that this level of logistical support is becoming more and more necessary.Until recently, practical-support organizations such as the Northwest Abortion Access Fund existed mainly to help, say, someone in rural eastern Oregon travel a few hours to a clinic in Boise, Idaho. But when Dobbs overturned Roe in 2022, aid organizations’ work became more in demand, more expensive, and more complicated, Marisa Falcon, the executive director of a hub for practical-support groups called Apiary, told me. A patient from Arkansas who has scheduled a procedure in Chicago, for example, might rely on a group in Illinois to book flights and hotels and another in Arkansas to drive them to the airport. Because of new restrictions in Idaho, the Northwest Abortion Access Fund spends more money sending patients from eastern Oregon to farther-away urban areas like Portland, as well as helping patients in Idaho leave the state. According to data that Kovacs shared with me, the organization spent an average of $585 on things like hotels and gas money per client in the two years before Dobbs; since Dobbs, the average is nearly $875. The number of clients seeking practical support has almost tripled.Support groups also told me that costs are rising because, as the number of clinics dwindles, appointment waiting lists are getting longer, so people wind up having abortions further into pregnancy. The longer a person waits to end their pregnancy, the more complicated and expensive abortion becomes; patients also take longer to recover. “What used to be a one-day activity is now a four-day activity where people need to leave their kids behind,” Falcon said. “Not only are the logistics more complicated, but it costs significantly more.”In the Dobbs decision, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that U.S. citizens have a “constitutional right to interstate travel,” including for abortions. But abortion opponents are nonetheless trying to prevent people from crossing state lines for care that they see as a threat to unborn life. In Alabama, for example, Attorney General Steve Marshall has said helping someone travel for an abortion is akin to a “criminal conspiracy.” Last year, Idaho outlawed helping a minor travel out of state for an abortion without parental permission. Tennessee passed a copycat law this year. So far both of these efforts have faced legal challenges, and similar bills introduced in other states have failed to advance. Texas has taken a different approach: Some local laws allow residents to sue anyone who assists a woman in traveling through their city or county to get an abortion in another state. At least one Texas man has already taken legal action against his former girlfriend, expressing an intent to file a wrongful-death suit against anyone who assisted her in allegedly pursuing an abortion out of state.Even if none of these legal efforts succeed, abortion opponents can try to limit the work of practical-support groups by restricting their funding. The organization representatives I spoke with said that the pace of their funding has not kept up with demand for their services. Some smaller groups simply don’t have enough money to meet demand. If abortion is further restricted—if, for example, mifepristone’s FDA approval is revoked, or if the lawsuit challenging it succeeds—demand for out-of-state travel will skyrocket again.Abortion support services rely mostly on donations, but some also receive funding from state or local governments. That government money has already become a target for anti-abortion groups seeking to curtail abortion travel. In 2023, for example, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment enshrining the right to an abortion; in response, a state legislator introduced a bill that would withhold state funding from cities and counties that give money to practical-support groups. Last month, ballot measures protecting abortion rights passed in seven states, and legislators in some of them may attempt to repeat the Ohio strategy. Kristi Hamrick, the vice president of media and policy for the anti-abortion group Students for Life Action, told me that the group opposes using any taxpayer funding for abortion travel and has already asked that Trump restrict the military’s funding of travel for service members seeking abortions.As travel plays a larger role in how Americans access abortions, it will also inevitably become a bigger target for abortion opponents. Practical-support groups told me that in recent years, abortion-rights advocates have focused on funding campaigns to pass legislation, leaving practical support groups short of the money necessary to serve a growing number of would-be travelers. People still need to travel or obtain medication to end their pregnancy in huge swaths of the country—even in places where abortion rights have notched recent victories. In Missouri, for example, a November ballot initiative made abortion legal, but a host of other laws could mean a long wait before abortions are widely available there. “Without abortion support organizations, people just won’t access abortion,” Serra Sippel, the executive director of the Brigid Alliance, told me. If advocates could wave a magic wand and reinstitute Roe tomorrow, it wouldn’t make a difference if people can’t get to a clinic—many of which no longer exist post-Dobbs. The most consequential fights, for now, may be the practical ones, even if they’re just about some gas money, a babysitter, and a winter coat.",

    "title": "A New Reckoning for Nuclear Energy",
    "author": "Matteo Wong",
    "date": "December 2, 2024",
    "text": "This spring kicked off the best stretch for America’s nuclear industry in decades. It started in April, when, for the first time since 1990, the United States added nuclear capacity for the second year in a row. In June, Congress passed a major law to accelerate nuclear-energy development. The Republican Party’s national platform trumpeted nuclear power, as did Kamala Harris in describing her economic agenda; this fall, three of the world’s largest companies—Amazon, Google, and Microsoft—announced substantial investments in nuclear-energy facilities. In November, the U.S. issued official goals to massively expand its nuclear capacity. “We have ambitious targets for the next 10 years,” Michael Goff, the acting assistant secretary of the Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy, told me, as well as for the decade after. The DOE aims to add roughly 60 times more nuclear power in a quarter century than the country built in the previous one.As recently as 15 years ago, or perhaps even five, imagining all of this would have been a stretch. For decades, the industry was stagnant and vehemently opposed by environmentalists. But nuclear energy—a potential source of abundant, reliable, emissions-free electricity—is a powerful tool to fight climate change, and now the federal government, major companies, and a growing number of climate advocates are supporting a series of nuclear-energy projects that could transform America’s grid. This is at least the country’s third attempt to do so—the original push to install a nationwide fleet of reactors ground to a spectacular halt in the 1980s, and a so-called nuclear “renaissance” in the late 2000s, which included dozens of proposed reactors, also failed to materialize. This round, “the industry itself has really got to deliver,” Goff said. The next few years might be the country’s last chance to get nuclear right.America’s opposition to nuclear power runs deep. Some of the oldest and most influential environmental groups, including Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, and the Natural Resources Defense Council, have long opposed the fallout from nuclear-weapons testing and, as an extension, the environmental risk of nuclear-power plants. Broader public attitudes turned against nuclear power when Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island facility suffered a meltdown in 1979. The Democratic Party officially opposed new nuclear plants the following year, and after the Chernobyl accident in 1986, nearly three-quarters of Americans said they were against the building of a nuclear plant within five miles of their home.Economic factors might have doomed nuclear build-out anyway. Energy companies did build many nuclear-power plants in the 1970s—and those plants still provide about one-fifth of the United States’ electricity today—but skyrocketing costs and interminable construction delays, combined with plateauing electricity demand, eventually made new facilities unattractive investments. The emergence of cheap natural gas in the 2000s has helped doom any nuclear growth since, Jessica Lovering, an expert on nuclear economics and the executive director of the Good Energy Collective, told me. (The Great Recession also helped squelch plans for new facilities, she said.)The result has been that, from 1979 to 1988, 67 reactors were canceled; for more than three decades, the nation has added barely any new nuclear capacity. The reactors that did open were years behind schedule. Beginning in the 1960s, the number of nuclear-engineering degrees granted each year steadily climbed, to a peak of roughly 1,500 in 1978, then plummeted to fewer than 400 by 2000.But then, slowly, Americans started studying nuclear engineering again. When Kathryn Huff, who led the U.S. Office for Nuclear Energy for two years prior to Goff, finished her Ph.D. in 2013, more than 1,000 nuclear-engineering degrees were being issued annually, a number that has remained roughly steady since. Huff now teaches nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and she told me that the motivation of her own cohort and her students is clear: “The reason people are in nuclear now is the environment.”Beginning in the 2000s, greenhouse-gas emissions and all their consequences for the planet were becoming a pressing concern for growing numbers of scientists, government officials, and even corporations. The link between commercial nuclear power and the Cold War and nuclear radiation had faded; more people learned that the technology was safer than fossil fuels, or even wind power, measured by deaths per unit of energy produced. As more places in the U.S. started building more renewable energy, experts found that a decarbonized grid running purely on solar panels and wind turbines might be impossible, or prohibitively expensive. The Department of Energy estimates, for instance, that each unit of energy from a renewable grid with nuclear power will cost 37 percent less than from a grid without. Huff told me her students “understand how much carbon-free power we need, and that’s what’s driving them into nuclear energy—and that’s also what’s happening in the Democratic Party.”In the past decade or so, more scientists and advocacy organizations began to mobilize around nuclear power. The Clean Air Task Force, for instance, concluded that nuclear energy was the “most advanced and proven” source of carbon-free, weather-independent power, the group’s executive director, Armond Cohen—who was a staunch anti-nuclear activist in the 1980s—told me. In 2015, four of the world’s most influential climate scientists wrote an editorial in The Guardian that called nuclear energy “the only viable path forward on climate change.” A 2018 United Nations special report found that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels would require “unprecedented changes”—including in the world’s energy systems, which made nuclear, as a scalable source of copious and clean electricity, still more appealing.The support for nuclear power in the U.S.—particularly among climate advocates—is far from unequivocal, but relative to a couple of decades ago, it represents an epochal shift, Ted Nordhaus, an early nuclear-energy advocate and the executive director of the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental research center that promotes nuclear energy, told me. In 2020, the Democratic Party’s platform endorsed nuclear energy for the first time since 1972. Bernie Sanders is a long-standing opponent of nuclear energy, but the Biden-Sanders Unity Taskforce—a group formed to unify the party’s more moderate and radical wings in 2020—listed nuclear as a key technology for combatting climate change. Federal efforts to build nuclear energy have run through the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden presidencies. Republicans have long supported nuclear as a matter of energy security and reliability; President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act includes substantial incentives for nuclear projects. Billions of dollars in corporate investment have gone to nuclear facilities and start-ups. Similar support exists across states as politically varied as Texas, California, Pennsylvania, and New York.One more factor has propelled the nuclear industry. After decades of relatively flat power use nationwide, AI and data-center growth are sending projections for electricity demand soaring upward, Goff said. Because many of the companies operating large data centers have made substantial climate commitments, they need abundant sources of carbon-free electricity, and see nuclear as the quickest and most reliable way of generating it. These giant tech firms appear willing to pay above-market rates to get those new nuclear-power sources up and running. “I just can’t think of any precedent for it,” Matt Bowen, a nuclear-energy researcher at Columbia, told me.Still, to speak of a nuclear “revival” might be premature—it’s more accurate to say that the industry is approaching an inflection point. To meet its ambitious nuclear targets, Goff said, the U.S. will likely need a mixture of existing and more experimental reactors. The next several years will be crucial for demonstrating that America can build a large nuclear fleet. Two recently completed reactors at a Georgia power plant—the project that made 2023 and 2024 the first consecutive years of added nuclear capacity in decades—have made that facility the nation’s largest single source of clean energy, but both were years behind schedule.Meanwhile, the “advanced nuclear” projects drawing attention from the federal government and tech companies will need to prove their case. These technologies, Lovering said, are smaller and simpler than the behemoth facilities of old, which should reduce costs and construction times. But more advanced nuclear technologies have been the industry’s promised future for decades now, and yet have never made the leap to regular deployment in the U.S. And the first commercial deployments will be expensive (efficiency gains and savings will likely accompany later iterations). Experts I spoke with had mixed opinions about whether a Republican-controlled government will continue the generous loans and tax incentives the initial projects depend on.Perhaps the greatest risk is that expectations are too high—that politicians and tech companies hope to be awash in abundant, cheap, nuclear-generated electricity within five years, instead of 10 or 20. An industry with so many decades of setbacks and failures cannot afford many more; if nuclear power really is so vital to decarbonization, then neither can the climate. The door is open for nuclear power, Cohen told me. “The question is whether we can have an industry that can walk through.”",

    "title": "This Influencer Says You Can’t Parent Too Gently",
    "author": "Olga Khazan",
    "date": "October 22, 2024",
    "text": "The kids held it together pretty well until right after gymnastics. At the end of a long day that included school, a chaotic playdate, and a mostly ignored lunch of sandwiches, the parenting coach Chelsey Hauge-Zavaleta picked up her twins from the tumbling gym around 5:30. The two 8-year-olds joined their 6-year-old sister inside Chelsey’s silver minivan.Chelsey, an energetic 41-year-old, promotes gentle parenting, a philosophy in which prioritizing a good relationship with your kid trumps getting them to obey you. I was tagging along with her family for a few days to see how her strategy—stay calm, name emotions, don’t punish kids for acting out—works in practice.During the long, hot, winding ride back home, things began to devolve. One of the girls didn’t want any music. One wanted music and to sing along. One was turning the heater up too high—at least according to her sister, who was overheating. (I agreed not to name the kids or to disclose which one behaved in which way.)Chelsey pulled over to settle everyone down. In the soothing, melodic tone that she recommends parents use with their children, she assured the girls that having some dinner would make them feel a lot better.“No it won’t,” one of the girls said.“You’re feeling like it won’t,” Chelsey said, validating her daughter’s feelings—another one of her parenting tricks.“Don’t talk to me like I’m 3 years old,” the girl shot back.By the time they arrived home, two girls were in tears. There were fruitless demands for screen time and ice cream. Chelsey held one sobbing child while another chopped vegetables. A freshly prepared soup was ignored, and the girls ate that ubiquitous kid comfort food: pasta with shredded cheese.To an untrained eye, it might look like Chelsey’s methods didn’t work that night. The evening seemed to substantiate the fears of parents and experts who think gentle parenting might be too gentle, turning kids into entitled monarchs and parents into their exhausted therapists. But Chelsey says her goal wasn’t to get the kids to behave better. It was to maintain her loving connection to them. She blamed herself for placing too many demands on them throughout the day, and for not preparing them for the presence of a reporter. “They were super dysregulated,” she told me later. “They didn’t have the capacity to cooperate.”I wouldn’t have handled the post-gymnastics meltdown exactly the way Chelsey did, but I’m also not sure how I would have handled it at all. (My son is six months old, so I have a little time before he starts complaining about my song choices.) I understand that you’re not supposed to yell at your kids, but also that, occasionally, you’re supposed to get them to do what you say—like briefly stop looking at a screen or eat some actual food. This is the essential conundrum that brings people to gentle parenting.By day, Chelsey runs a parent-coaching business with her own mom, Robin Hauge. I’m like a lot of the parents who turn to them for help, and like a lot of the Millennials who are nervously having kids these days: schooled in the latest child-psychology research, in possession of disposable income, and desperately trying to do better than my own parents. Many clients, Robin told me, are “searching for something different than they had.” Maybe that something, I thought, is gentle parenting.I found Chelsey through TikTok, where she has some 300,000 followers. Almost as soon as the blue plus sign materialized on my pregnancy test last July, the app’s algorithm magically took note and began serving me her videos.My husband and I spurred this process along, cramming, as we were, for the midterm known as “baby.” We bought books. We downloaded name apps. We fought sectarian wars over the relative correctness of rival infant-sleep strategies. The parenting internet was happy to oblige. At one point, I saw an Instagram post that explained how to talk to my kid about avocados. (Hint: Do not say “they’re good for you!”) It was all so confusing, and I desperately wanted to do it right.Chelsey seemed to offer a step-by-step parenting plan. In one video, she shows just how solicitous gentle parents should be toward their children. Role-playing both the parent and the child, she demonstrated what not to do when your kid refuses to put her jacket on.Wearing a pink bike helmet, Chelsey portrays a willful child screaming, “I don’t want to put my stupid jacket on!” Then, slightly louder, Chelsey plays the mom, saying, “I don’t care! It’s cold outside. Put your jacket on!” Playing the child again, Chelsey grabs the jacket and thrashes it around the room.Then Chelsey breaks character to address her TikTok audience. By yelling over her child, Chelsey explains, she escalated the situation. If this happens, she says, the parent should soften her demeanor. They could, for example, apologize. “You know what, sweet pea? That was really tricky with the jacket,” the parent should say. “I’m so sorry … I’m going to work on using my inside voice.” Then she could cook her kid’s favorite dinner to make up for it. If your child doesn’t respond when you apologize, Chelsey says, that’s fine—it’s on you to repair the relationship.Chelsey also explains how a parent should handle a child screaming about her jacket. Instead of yelling back, she says, you should speak in a whisper and carry the jacket yourself, or stuff it into their backpack. “Frankly,” she says, “I would not force a kid to put a jacket on.”Watching the video, I tried to imagine my parents apologizing to me after I refused to do something they said. This was difficult, because my parents have never apologized to me, and also, until I was well into my 20s, I never refused to do anything they said.Russian parents like mine, who believe that children should always listen to their parents and that getting cold is a death sentence, would have long ago hit “Unfollow.” Indeed, when I recently told my cousin about gentle parenting, he scoffed. “This is the road to prison,” he said.I don’t have many parenting role models who aren’t Russian. Most of my American friends don’t have kids. I myself grew up in the ’90s in West Texas, where a “gentle” punishment meant detention instead of a beating. I want to do better by my son—if only I can figure out how.Chelsey and her husband, Samuel, live with the girls in an airy house tucked into a redwood forest north of Santa Cruz, California. Their days consist of work-from-home sprints interrupted by taxiing their kids to school and activities, a lifestyle that’s common in their area.In 2018, Chelsey, who has a Ph.D. in education, was working as a research associate at Stanford, parenting three children under 3, and also helping raise her teenage niece, who had come from Mexico to stay with the family for a while. By her own description, she was flailing. One morning, all three of the little girls fought over the one purple spoon in a set of rainbow-colored spoons. Chelsey tried suggesting the yellow spoon, or the red spoon, or that they take turns with the purple spoon. No dice. “It was like, everybody all crying all the time,” she told me.Noticing her struggles, Robin, Chelsey’s mom, who runs a school for children with behavioral problems, thought Chelsey might benefit from taking a parenting class she offered, in which she taught parents how to handle challenging children. Perhaps sensing how such a proposal would land with her own adult daughter, she had Chelsey’s cousin bring up the idea. “You can’t suggest anything to your daughter,” Robin told me.Chelsey was skeptical. But she now says the course “changed everything.” Previously, she had tried to learn about gentle parenting—which is also sometimes called respectful parenting, and arose in the middle of the 20th century out of concerns that parents were too harsh—from reading books, but she didn’t understand how to put the ideas into practice. The class made Chelsey realize that she was speaking to her kids negatively much of the time—stop hitting your sister! Often, what the kids needed was not more instructions but what she calls “connection,” or feeling loved and seen by their parents. (The correct way to resolve the spoon fight, Chelsey says, was to validate each child’s reality, saying something like “You really wanted the purple spoon. The orange spoon doesn’t taste good.” The child might still pout, but that’s okay.)Chelsey and Robin both say that Chelsey and her brother were parented gently—Robin never yelled, for instance. But there was a difference between experiencing gentle parenting herself and seeing how it could apply to her own kids.After the class was over, Robin never said “I told you so.” That’s something “you never do as a mother,” she told me. One of Robin’s first recommendations is to rid your interactions with your child of these types of “zingers.” They feel like an “eff you,” she said. (I always thought that was the point.)Chelsey left her job at Stanford to help her mother teach a course called Guiding Cooperation. Together, they grew that course into a business. They charge a fee that starts at $5,000 per family for a 12-week parenting program that includes video lessons along with group and individual coaching. At any given time, the program includes about 40 to 50 families, they said, whose kids typically range in age from 2 to 13.In one Zoom group-coaching session I observed, Chelsey asked her parent-clients to close their eyes and imagine sitting at a table with all the materials they’d need to work on a beloved project. “Around the table are all of the people that are the perfectly right people to do this project with,” she said softly. “Maybe you’re creating; maybe there’s bowls of yarn, or computers, laptops.”Then, suddenly, she started clapping loudly. “Get the laptops, get everything! There’s a giant fire! Take that out of the room!” she yelled.Chelsey asked the parents how that felt. They said alarming, panicky, and angry. Chelsey explained that many children are in this state when parents try to transition them from one activity to another too quickly. “The same body sensations happen for our kids,” she explained.This is a recurring theme of Chelsey and Robin’s advice—that kids have many of the same emotions adults do. When they’re overwhelmed, they sometimes cry and scream. Don’t you? When punished, they don’t think about what they’ve done; they stew.The goal of their programs is to decrease tantrums, but not through punishments or even rewards like sticker charts (too transactional, and kids often stop caring about the stickers). Chelsey says she has never given her girls a time-out. Rather than compliance, Chelsey and Robin seek cooperation—meaning the child does what you say because they want to do it. “I don’t even use the word obey or disobey,” Robin told me.Instead of ordering kids to stop doing something, Chelsey advocates “positive opposites”—telling kids what they can do instead. Don’t instruct them not to jump on the couch; tell them to jump on the trampoline.Praise for good behavior is a part of Chelsey’s philosophy, but she warns that this, too, requires care. Many parents go with “good job,” for instance. But Chelsey argues that this is confusing, because children don’t have jobs. Instead, she suggests commenting on specific things children do well, such as “You came down to dinner on time! Cool!” and “You’re sitting next to your sister keeping your hands on your own body? That’s awesome!”During transitions, she recommends talking to younger kids in a sing-songy voice and in a kind of broken English: Okay, water bottle in backpack, now we’re walking to car. She says it’s easier for kids to process information this way. Chelsey and Robin suggest trying these strategies three to five times before switching tactics if they don’t seem to be working.Psychologists I interviewed said that some of these strategies are evidence-based and effective. Most kids respond well to praise, for example, and tactics like singing and offering alternatives can make it more fun for kids to do what they’re told. However, they argue that consequences are also important, and that showering kids with positive attention when they misbehave can backfire. Time-out, in particular, has been proved to change behavior and improve academic performance, says Corey Lieneman, a clinical child psychologist at the University of Nebraska who co-wrote a book about time-out. For older kids, she told me, taking away privileges such as video games is effective—and is, in a way, a form of time-out. Lieneman also said there’s nothing wrong with using rewards, because “no little kid is going to just want to do all of the things that we want them to do.”Chelsey and Robin admit that their method can be difficult, but they argue that this is just how much effort it takes to be a parent—especially when you have strong-willed kids. They push back on the typical reassurance that all a parent really needs is to be “good enough”—the early-child psychologist D. W. Winnicott’s notion that a parent need not be perfect, but “ordinary devoted.” “Good-enough parenting is not actually good enough for all children,” Chelsey says in another TikTok video. If you have a more challenging child, she says, “you’re gonna have to be more intentional, you’re gonna have to be more careful with your language, you’re gonna have to spend more time co-regulating. And honestly, what a gift that is, to have a child who demands more.”There’s no way to objectively measure Chelsey’s success. She and her mom say that no one has ever asked for their money back, and that most parents see good results.But some parents may struggle to raise their kids this way. For one thing, although Chelsey argues that you would feel less busy if you yelled at your kids less, some parents work so much that there’s no time to prepare a special apology dinner. The U.S. surgeon general recently deemed parental stress a public-health concern, in part because of the sheer amount of time this kind of intensive parenting requires.I spoke with one mom, Katerina, who hasn’t taken Chelsey’s class but who learned about gentle parenting through her own reading. (She asked to go by her first name only because she has a public-facing role at work.) For a while, she said, she tried to be an ultra-gentle parent with her two girls, but she found it hard to find time to validate all of their feelings and still get dinner on the table. “It requires a certain level of commitment and capacity that I think most moms don’t have,” she told me. She ultimately landed on trying to talk through her kids’ feelings most of the time, but also sometimes using rewards and consequences, such as taking away her 9-year-old’s chocolate for lying. “She accepted her fate,” she told me.And although children’s emotions are obviously important, some parenting researchers feel that gentle parenting doesn’t sufficiently emphasize how kids’ actions can affect other people. What if, in refusing to put her jacket on, the child made her sister late for school too? (Robin and Chelsey counter that they are teaching kids how to be empathetic by modeling empathy toward them.) “Societies all around the world also focus on how your actions and your words affect other people’s feelings,” Michaeleen Doucleff, an NPR science correspondent and the author of Hunt, Gather, Parent: What Ancient Cultures Can Teach Us About the Lost Art of Raising Happy, Helpful Little Humans, told me. Some gentle-parenting experts promote empathizing with kids by saying things like I know, it’s so hard to share. “Well, is it? Is it hard to share?” Doucleff said. Do you actually want your kid to think that?Rebecah Freeling, another Bay Area parenting coach, who specializes in kids with behavioral problems, says that gentle parenting can leave some parents struggling to set boundaries. What happens if you’re validating feelings and heaping on praise, but your kid still does drugs behind your back?Chelsey says kids should never be punished, other than through occasional “natural and logical consequences”—like if a child throws and breaks the TV remote and it will no longer turn on the TV. Even something egregious, such as a teenager skipping school, Chelsey says should be handled by trying to determine, “What is going on at school, that you are not going?”The most obvious problem with this approach is that it doesn’t adequately prepare children for the real world, where a boss is less likely to ask “What is going on at work, that you are not going?” than she is to fire you if you don’t show up.But children, Chelsey counters, “are going to learn to be responsible adults when their nervous systems are honored.” She also seems to have a rather rosy view of corporate America: If you’re failing at work, “I hope your boss is supporting you to get back to a place of regulation so that you can do the work.”In Freeling’s view, however, it’s acceptable for a teen to, say, lose a preordained amount of screen time if they won’t fulfill basic responsibilities. Some parents who have tried gentle parenting come to Freeling saying that they feel bullied by their kids, or like they can’t ever say no. Some, Freeling said, sound like they’re describing an abusive relationship with a spouse: I do everything he asks, and he’s still hitting me. Sometimes, even connecting with your kid can start to feel transactional—I’m connecting. Why aren’t you listening? One mother told Freeling that after she stopped trying to apply gentle parenting, “she could now free herself from the belief that she wasn’t loving her child right.”When I asked Robin if people have trouble remembering the techniques she and Chelsey teach, she said, “One hundred percent.” Indeed, their tactics seem hard to recall, and to execute, when everyone is tired and hungry and preoccupied—so much so that even Chelsey sometimes deviates from her own advice. She says she doesn’t make her kids share, but when I was with them, one of the girls tried to call dibs on a bag of potato chips, and Chelsey told her to give some to her sisters. When one of the girls began eating cantaloupe with a ladle, Chelsey told her, “Not for eating, honey,” which is not a positive opposite. “It would have been stronger had I said, ‘We eat with a spoon,’” she acknowledged later.After a few days with Chelsey and Robin, though, I came around to the view that their work is more than just a series of expensive scripts that you’ll strain to remember mid-meltdown. I realized that sometimes the point of this kind of program is to be not a permanent cure but a kind of ongoing emotional support. Watching Chelsey’s group-coaching sessions, I noticed that many parents seemed worried they were the only ones who couldn’t get their kids to behave. One mom, whose child had ripped something off the wall on the way out of preschool, said she feels “shame around the perceived idea that I can’t control my kid.”As dozens of people have already warned me, parenting is the “hardest job you’ll ever have,” and I got the sense that, for her clients and TikTok followers, Chelsey is shouldering some of this intensely personal toil. There is something about Chelsey that makes people feel like it’s all going to be okay—you’re going to do better than your parents, but you’ll also mess up a lot, and that’s normal.“In the ’90s, gentle parenting was, like, smacking your kid with the spoon instead of your hand,” said Mary Brock, one of the parents on the call. Later, she told me she likes how Chelsey and Robin listen to her, and give her encouragement without judgment. “I wish I had a gentle parent,” Brock added. “That’s what this class does for me.”Chelsey often says that the first step to calming your kids is to calm yourself. Maybe gentle parenting, then, is less about soothing kids than it is about soothing their parents.",

Each new title set off new alarms.When Patel was installed as chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense just after the 2020 election, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised him not to break the law in order to keep President Donald Trump in power. “Life looks really shitty from behind bars,” Milley reportedly told Patel. (Patel denies this.)When Trump entertained naming Patel deputy director of the FBI, Attorney General Bill Barr confronted the White House chief of staff and said, “Over my dead body.”When, in the final weeks of the administration, Trump planned to name Patel deputy director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, the agency’s head, threatened to resign. Trump relented only after an intervention by Vice President Mike Pence and others.Who was this man, and why did so many top officials fear him?It wasn’t a question of ideology. He wasn’t a zealot like Stephen Miller, trying to make the bureaucracy yield to his agenda. Rather, Patel appeared singularly focused on pleasing Trump. Even in an administration full of loyalists, Patel was exceptional in his devotion.This was what seemed to disturb many of his colleagues the most: Patel was dangerous, several of them told me, not because of a certain plan he would be poised to carry out if given control of the CIA or FBI, but because he appeared to have no plan at all—his priorities today always subject to a mercurial president’s wishes tomorrow. (Patel disputes this characterization.)What wouldn’t a person like that do, if asked?Most Americans had no idea Patel existed, yet rarely a day passed when administration leaders weren’t reminded that he did. In a year and eight months, they had watched Patel leapfrog from the National Security Council, where he became senior counterterrorism director; to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, where he was principal deputy to the acting director; to the Department of Defense, where his influence rivaled that of the acting secretary himself.But in the officials’ warnings about the various catastrophic ways the rise of an inexperienced lackey to the highest levels of government might end, all Patel seemed to detect was the panic of a “deep state” about to be exposed. Such officials understood, as Patel later wrote, that he “wouldn’t sit quietly and accept their actions to stonewall direct orders from the president.”Patel was ultimately denied a role at the pinnacle of the national-security establishment, but Trump has promised to learn from his mistakes. Should he return to the White House, there will be no Milleys, Haspels, or even Barrs to restrain him as he seeks revenge against his political enemies. Instead, there will be Patels—those whose true faith and allegiance belong not to a nation, but to one man.“Get ready, Kash,” Trump said before a gala of young Republicans this past December. “Get ready.”A cursory appraisal of Patel’s activities since the Trump administration might suggest that his days as a senior official in the United States government are behind him—that Patel, like countless others on the right, has learned the art of commodifying his association with the former president.There is, for example, merch: “the official K$h wine!” ($233.99 for six bottles) and the Fight With Kash Punisher Intarsia Reversible Scarf ($25), which Patel wore for his remarks at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference. There are TAKE A LAP RHINO tank tops ($35), JUSTICE FOR ALL #J6PC tees (also $35), and Kash Krew Golf Polos ($50–$53).There are the books. Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy is Patel’s account of his years fighting the “corrupt cabal” of federal officials trying to take down Trump. And in The Plot Against the King, a children’s book, Patel tells the story of a wizard named Kash who sets out to save King Donald from the sinister machinations of Hillary Queenton and a “shifty knight.” Head over to fightwithkash.com, and for a “special low offer” of $19.99, one can purchase playing cards (“the collector’s item of the century”) featuring the story’s characters; the king card belongs to “Kash, the distinguished wizard and corruption combatant.”There is at least one song: Patel produced “Justice for All,” a version of the national anthem sung by jailed January 6 defendants and played by Trump at his first 2024 campaign rally. Patel professes to make no money from the song or the merch—he says proceeds go to January 6 defendants and their families, or to the Kash Foundation. Few details are available about the charity, but according to Patel, it has funded meals for needy families and defamation lawsuits on behalf of Ric Grenell, Patel’s friend and former boss at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and Daniel Bostic, a “Stop the Steal” activist. (Just as this article was going to press, most of the merch was removed from Patel’s online shop.)All the while, Patel churns out promotional content on Truth Social—for a conservative cellphone carrier (“Freedom in cell phones, switch today”) and a Christian payment processor (“Why not just give your money to the enemy, or switch now”)—and hawks pills that he says “reverse” the effects of COVID vaccines (“Mrna detox, reverse the vaxx n get healthy”).He has also worked as a national security adviser to Trump (bringing in more than $300,000 over the past two years from the former president’s Save America PAC, according to campaign-finance records) and as a consultant for Trump Media & Technology Group, the owner of Truth Social ($130,000 last year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing). In addition, Patel has spoken of work abroad, though public paper trails are hard to come by—he has claimed, for example, that he worked as a security consultant for Qatar during the 2022 FIFA World Cup, in Doha.Nevertheless, Patel has at times vented that he deserves more, according to two people I spoke with. “He complains about money all the time—like, he doesn’t have any money, can’t make any money, nobody will hire him,” a longtime Trump adviser told me. “Anybody who was as big of a deal as he was in the past administration would come out and they’d be on the board of Raytheon and Boeing.” (This person, like many of the nearly 40 Patel associates I spoke with for this story, requested anonymity for fear of retribution. Patel, who declined to be interviewed, denied this through a spokesperson.)From the time Patel left the administration, he appeared committed to finding opportunities to reinforce his loyalty to Trump. In spring 2022, after the FBI opened a criminal investigation into Trump’s handling of federal records at Mar-a-Lago, Patel insinuated himself into the story, telling Breitbart News that he witnessed Trump verbally declassify “whole sets of materials” before leaving the presidency. The claim ensured a starring role for Patel throughout the probe—ending with Patel testifying before a federal grand jury in exchange for a grant of limited immunity. More crucially, Patel’s assertion to Breitbart seemed to preview Trump’s own approach to the case: In August, shortly after federal investigators executed a search on Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s office claimed that, as president, he had a standing order that any materials moved from the Oval Office to Mar-a-Lago were considered declassified. It did not appear to bother Patel that numerous Trump officials flatly denied the existence of such an order.That October, the far-right personality Benny Johnson asked Patel on his podcast how he would respond if Trump offered him the job of FBI director in a second term. Patel leaned back, laughed, and waved off the question, but a minute later he decided to chime in after all. “Yes, to answer your question, of course,” he said. “Who would turn that down?” Some in Trump’s orbit acknowledge that Senate confirmation is unlikely for Patel—that if he were to lead an agency, it would probably be in an acting capacity. On a podcast in November 2023, Donald Trump Jr. floated the idea of installing Patel as an “interim” attorney general at the outset “just to send that shot across the bow of the swamp.”Such is the present dynamic of Kash Patel’s life: marketing “Orange Man Bad” Punisher-skull license plates and dubious supplements while fielding questions about which major national-security or law-enforcement agency he might soon like to run. “Kash, I know you’re probably going to be head of the CIA,” Steve Bannon said on his podcast, War Room, this past December. “But do you believe that you can deliver the goods on this in pretty short order, the first couple of months, so we can get rolling on prosecutions?”Bannon was talking here about “receipts,” the supposedly incriminating documents and emails that a second Trump administration would use to bring cases against deep-state dwellers and members of the press. Patel expressed no doubt about his capacity to deliver the goods. “We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media,” he said. “Yes, we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections—we’re going to come after you.”“A lot of people say he’s crazy,” Trump once said of Patel, according to the longtime adviser. “I think he’s kind of crazy. But sometimes you need a little crazy.”It was only a matter of time before they found each other, is how Patel seemed to see it. Just a “couple of guys from Queens,” he has said, trying to synonymize his brand with Trump’s home borough, and the scrappy knuckle-crack caricature that comes with it. In Government Gangsters, Patel reminds readers of this piece of shared heritage four times.Perhaps it makes sense, then, to go back to the beginning, to the affluent Nassau County village of Garden City, New York, where Kashyap Patel was actually born and raised. Just north of the Garden City Golf Club, one finds the charming corner-lot home to which he returned after school and football practice and hockey games and occasionally, yes, a father-son jaunt for butter chicken about an hour away in Queens. Just a guy from Garden City—it’s true; it doesn’t quite sing.Patel, who is of Gujarati ancestry, has said that his parents both grew up in East Africa; in the 1970s, his father, Pramod, fled the despotic regime of Idi Amin in Uganda. The young couple immigrated to the United States and settled on Long Island. Children soon followed. Their first chapter in America began in close quarters, according to Patel, with his family and Pramod’s eight siblings all sharing the same home.Before long, Patel writes in his book, his family gained access to the thrills of “milquetoast Americana”—New York Islanders hockey games, annual sojourns to Disney World. It was the Reagan era, and in 1988, Patel’s parents registered to vote for the first time in the U.S., as Republicans. But their conservatism, according to Patel, was “dispositional”—they valued hard work, fairness, personal responsibility. American opportunity, meanwhile, arrived just as advertised: Pramod ultimately became CFO at a global distributor of aircraft bearings.Patel was raised Hindu, the family going to temple together and praying in their shrine room at home. It’s difficult to envision many neighbors joining them. Of the roughly 22,000 residents recorded in Garden City in the 1990 census, 96 percent were white. Four years later, when Patel began his freshman year at Garden City High School, he was one of only a handful of people of color in his class.His senior-yearbook quote came from the Jewish theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel: “Racism is man’s gravest threat—the maximum of hatred for a minimum reason.”In Garden City, Patel caddied for “very wealthy” and “important” New Yorkers at the local country club, some of them defense attorneys, he writes in Government Gangsters; as they played, he listened to their stories about the drama of court. “I could be a first-generation immigrant lawyer at a white shoe firm making a ton of money,” Patel thought. After he graduated from the University of Richmond and then Pace University’s law school, however, his dreams of Big Law and high retainers were complicated when, by his account, no firm would hire him.On the advice of a friend, he sent an application to the Miami-Dade County public defender’s office in Florida, considered one of the best state defender’s offices in the country. Many of the people I spoke with for this story were quick to highlight his time as a public defender—how incongruous it seems in the context of the revenge-driven exploits that now appear to consume him. Public records show that Patel moved into a condo in a new building in Coral Gables, which his parents bought in the summer of 2005. “He just was a normal, good lawyer; did a good job, never stood out,” recalled Bennett Brummer, who was the Miami-Dade elected public defender for 32 years. Patel writes that, by this time, he was shifting “more and more to the right.” But even if he struck his colleagues as a little more conservative than the norm, as Todd Michaels, who was an attorney in the Miami-Dade office, put it to me, he was not overtly partisan.State court was well suited to Patel’s strengths as an attorney, his former colleagues told me. He was personable and quick on his feet, and adept at “marketing” and “presenting” himself. After a few years, however, Patel moved to the federal public defender’s office in Miami. There, the work was more complex, more writing- and research-intensive. Despite some successes, he developed a reputation for “style over substance,” a former colleague said—one he seemed aware of but not terribly motivated to change. “He always was like, ‘Look, I’m really good at trial skill. But all of this reading and writing and arguing about, like, the intricacies of the law—I’m not really interested,’ ” a second former colleague recalled. (Patel disputed this characterization, referring to a complex drug-trafficking case he’d handled.)“I’m not saying he wasn’t capable of it,” this person added. “But I think he always liked being the face.”Transcripts from Patel’s cases reveal a lawyer comfortable before the bench, many of his presentations sharp and clever and peppered with flatteries for Your Honor. (“Judge, I think you hit it on the head last week.”) They were also embroidered with performative modesties: “On my best day, I’m an average defense attorney”; “I’m not a mathematician, but …”; “I’m not saying I’m a Spanish expert, Judge, but …”; “I know I’ve been doing this by far the shortest time of any lawyer sitting here.”Many times, this worked. “There were certain judges that he kind of had magic in front of,” the second former colleague said.This former colleague began to notice flashes of grievance in the young attorney, but they didn’t seem grounded in politics so much as insecurity. This person recalled that when Patel would ask for help on legal research, he would occasionally offer some version of Well, thank God I talked to someone who is book smart and went to all the right schools and checked all the right boxes. “He would always phrase it like a compliment, but there was an edge to it.”It became clear that Patel “did kind of have a chip on his shoulder,” this former colleague said—that he seemed caught between a brewing resentment of elites and an abiding desire to be seen as one.By early 2014, Patel had left Miami to become a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C. He’d landed a job in the counterterrorism section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. Yet in Patel’s telling, what should have been a dream chapter in the career of a young lawyer fast became a study in the rot of bureaucracy—and the malicious repercussions for those who dared to challenge it.This education began with Benghazi.Patel was one of the attorneys from the main Justice Department office who assisted the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington in pursuing foreign militants for the September 11, 2012, attacks that killed four Americans. In his book, Patel writes that as the Justice Department moved to bring the Benghazi terrorists to court, “I was leading the prosecution’s efforts at Main Justice.” He claims that he proceeded to watch firsthand as senior DOJ leadership and other Obama officials—“political gangsters, frauds, and hypocrites” such as Attorney General Eric Holder and his successor, Loretta Lynch—chose to “go soft” on the terrorists by prosecuting only one perpetrator. It was for this reason, Patel writes—a lack of trust in the prosecution’s decisions—that when his supervisors asked him to join the trial team itself, he declined.When I put this version of events to three people familiar with the prosecution, I was met with astonishment. One of these people said simply: “Good God.”Although Patel was Main Justice’s representative on the case for a period, the U.S. Attorney’s Office led the prosecution, they said. The department prosecuted a single suspect, they added, because he was the only one the government had been able to capture. (DOJ later prosecuted a second suspect, and reportedly brought charges against multiple others.) Patel was tasked with coordinating approvals for warrants and indictments, among other responsibilities. Moreover, he did not decline an invitation to join the team working on the actual trial; according to two of his former DOJ colleagues, he was never asked. After clashing with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, he was removed from the case altogether. (Patel denied this, saying he was simply reassigned to a different position.)What all parties seem to agree on is that the young attorney had grown bitter toward the system that had employed him for the better part of his career. And an unexpected confrontation in Texas transformed the building friction into a personal declaration of war.In January 2016, Patel traveled to Tajikistan to interview witnesses for an Islamic State–related case. While he was there, a federal judge in Houston scheduled a surprise hearing in another terrorism case Patel was involved in. He had less than 24 hours to make it to Texas, and having brought only slacks and a blazer on his trip, he contacted the local U.S. Attorney’s Office asking for a tie. But when Patel finally arrived at the courthouse, for reasons that remain in dispute, there was no tie.Judge Lynn Nettleton Hughes lost it. “If you want to be a lawyer, dress like a lawyer,” Hughes snapped in chambers. “Act like a lawyer.” Hughes proceeded to berate Patel as “just one more nonessential employee from Washington.” “What is the utility to me and to the people of America to have you fly down here at their expense?” he said. “You don’t add a bit of value, do you?” The judge dismissed Patel from chambers.Patel’s bosses were furious on his behalf. Hughes, then 74, had a history of eruptions in court, including disturbing remarks about race. Three years earlier, an Indian American plaintiff had tried but failed to have the judge removed from his discrimination case after Hughes held forth in a pretrial conference on “Adolf Hitler’s use of swastikas, the origin of Caucasians and the futility of diversity programs at universities,” the Texas Observer reported. DOJ officials’ attempts to get a transcript of the Patel exchange only enraged Hughes further; the judge issued an “Order on Ineptitude” castigating the “pretentious lawyers” at Main Justice.The Washington Post included all of this in a report on the incident. In the article, Patel comes across as a sympathetic figure. But the Justice Department chose not to comment, and for Patel, this was what counted. He writes in his book that, although his superiors privately praised him for keeping a level head, they “refused to say any of that publicly,” standing by as the media “dragged my name through the mud.”Patel brought complaints again and again to the leadership of the department’s National Security Division—adamant that something be done to hold the Texas prosecutors to account for not standing up for him in front of the judge, one of his former DOJ colleagues recalled. It wasn’t that his superiors had failed to understand his frustration; yes, they agreed, the judge was a “wack job,” in the words of the second former DOJ colleague, and they had called the U.S. Attorney’s Office to express their disappointment. “I finally said, ‘I don’t really know what else you want,’ ” the first former colleague recalled. “ ‘The U.S. attorney is presidentially appointed, like, I—what do you want us to do?’ ”“He just felt so aggrieved,” this person added, “and this continued throughout the rest of his tenure. And I actually think it was part of why he left.”The lesson of the bench slap and its aftermath, as Patel explains in Government Gangsters, was this: Although he had tried “to do my best to serve my country,” senior government officials had “refused to step up to the plate” for him in return. Patel decided to stop working for “cowards.”The next year, he met Devin Nunes.In Patel’s children’s book The Plot Against the King, Duke Devin bursts into the home of Kash, the wizard. The duke is distressed because ever since Choosing Day, a “shifty knight” (otherwise known as Democratic Representative Adam Schiff) has been proclaiming that King Donald cheated his way past Hillary Queenton to the throne. He begs Kash, known throughout the Land of the Free as the “Distinguished Discoverer,” to enlist in “the Quest for the Truth about the Plot against the King,” and after some consideration, Kash agrees.Patel tends to emphasize his reluctance when he recounts going to work for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in April 2017, whether he is a teal-caped wizard in the telling or just another 30-something civil servant looking for the next thing. He has said that when he first met with Nunes, the committee’s Republican chair, about a staff opening on the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, he thought the job sounded boring; what Patel had really wanted, since Trump’s election, was to work in the White House. But Nunes won him over, Patel writes in Government Gangsters, by promising to recommend him for a spot on Trump’s National Security Council once the probe concluded.Patel would devote the next several months to examining the FBI’s rationale for wiretapping the former Trump-campaign adviser Carter Page, and to uncovering the origins of the infamous Steele dossier. In interviews, staffers and committee members recalled Patel as personable, hardworking, and not noticeably partisan. “He was instrumental in helping us understand what the FBI would have had in their possession,” Mike Conaway, a Republican member of the committee at the time, said. A former Democratic committee staffer told me that Patel at first impressed even some in the minority as “exceedingly nice.”Some of the Republicans on the committee grew frustrated, however, by Patel’s emerging tendency to go rogue. One of the more surprising examples of this came just a few months into his tenure, when Patel and a colleague turned up unannounced at the London office of Christopher Steele’s lawyer, where Patel left his business card. (“We did everything by the book,” Patel later wrote of the incident.) One Republican staffer, initially taken by Patel’s charisma, came to view him as a “spotlight ranger.”In January 2018, as the committee’s majority neared the completion of a report on its findings, Nunes and his staff, including Patel, met with then–Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein at the Justice Department. By all accounts, the conversation grew contentious as Nunes pressed Rosenstein to furnish more documents to the committee. According to a statement later issued by the Justice Department, Nunes warned that he would act to hold Rosenstein in contempt of Congress, and Rosenstein issued a warning of his own: Should Nunes pursue that route, Rosenstein was prepared to subpoena the committee’s communications to defend himself.Patel interpreted Rosenstein’s warning as a “direct and personal threat against” him—one of the nation’s top officials retaliating against a House staffer out of fear of the “corruption I was about to expose.” As Patel tells it in his book, he immediately contacted senior staff to House Speaker Paul Ryan to share news of the attack on one of their own employees, and Ryan’s office “flatly refused to have my back.” A former Ryan aide described the exchange to me this way: “Kash seemed to think there was some magic wand the speaker had to stop people from saying things Kash didn’t like.”Suddenly everything seemed to make sense to Patel. Different setting, different time, but same deep state, same story: Here, in new form, was the Justice Department refusing to defend him against “the unstable judge in Houston,” he writes; here was Washington’s dogmatic lack of interest in “defending what’s right” made coldly manifest.The majority’s four-page report, of which Patel was a primary author, was ultimately found to have credibly identified errors and omissions in the FBI and DOJ’s applications to surveil Carter Page, though an inspector general did not corroborate the memo’s suggestion that the surveillance was politically motivated. When it was released, the so-called Nunes memo was framed by much of the media as politically charged fiction, and Patel was identified for his role in writing it. On February 2, 2018, The New York Times published an article headlined “Kashyap Patel, Main Author of Secret Memo, Is No Stranger to Quarrels.”The article cited Patel’s run-in with the Houston judge as a key example of his history of “quarrels,” offering a pared-down version of events that seemed to render Patel the irresponsible offender of a sober-minded judge. The incident, in other words, had been elevated to a defining place in the public narrative of Patel’s career—just as he’d always seemed to fear. “He felt extraordinarily mistreated,” another former Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee told me.As Patel came to feature in more and more stories about the Russia investigation, he seemed to embrace the view that any criticism of him or his work—valid or not—was evidence of a coordinated smear campaign. “All their attacks only convinced me that we were on to something big,” Patel writes in his book.A few months later, by his own admission, he decided to leak intelligence-committee emails regarding Rosenstein’s “chilling” and “sustained personal attack” against him to Fox News. Shortly after an article ran, according to Patel, Ryan approached him on the House floor and asked him to stop shopping stories to the press.“Absolutely,” Patel claims to have replied. “I would have no problem doing that the moment he, as the Speaker of the House, started having the backs of people falsely attacked for their work on behalf of the House.” (A spokesperson for Ryan told me that neither Ryan nor his staff has “any recollection of this occurring.”)They’d given him no choice, Patel reasoned. Somewhere along the way, the plot against the king had turned into a plot against the wizard himself.By the winter of 2018, Republicans had lost the House, and Schiff was set to take over the intelligence committee. Patel later wrote that Nunes, as promised, urged Trump to hire his protégé onto the National Security Council. According to Patel, when Trump realized just whom Nunes was referring to—the man who “had saved his presidency by revealing the unprecedented political hit job designed to take him down”—he ordered his chief of staff to onboard Patel at once.Former administration officials told me that, from his first days as a staffer on the National Security Council, in February 2019, Patel was fixated on trying to get face time with Trump. He had a script, and it wasn’t long before many of his colleagues could recite it themselves: “Mr. President, the deep state is out to get you,” as the longtime Trump adviser paraphrased it, “and I’m going to save you from it.” Five months into his tenure, Patel was made the senior director of the NSC’s counterterrorism directorate.Much has been written about Patel’s year on the National Security Council, including the early suspicions among his colleagues that he was funneling information about Ukraine directly to Trump, outside official channels. In the former president’s first impeachment inquiry, the NSC official Fiona Hill testified about learning from another colleague that Trump apparently viewed Patel as the council’s director on Ukraine policy, though his portfolio had nothing to do with Ukraine. Hill said she had been sufficiently alarmed to report the conversation to her superior and then warn her colleagues to be “very careful” in their communications with Patel. “Let’s just say it’s a red flag,” she testified, “when somebody who you barely know is involved on one of your policy issues” and “clearly providing materials outside of the line”—particularly when she didn’t know what those materials were.Patel has repeatedly denied ever discussing Ukraine with Trump. In his rendering, his colleagues were jealous of his close relationship with the president and still hated him for the Russia investigation. Not only was the deep state’s plot against him still in motion, Patel seemed to decide, but it had expanded.For the most part, this is how he explains the rest of his time in the Trump administration, why it is that at virtually every turn—from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to the Department of Defense to very nearly the FBI and CIA—there emerges yet another crop of officials who object to his accrual of power. It could not possibly be the case, for example, that Bill Barr harbored genuine concerns about Patel’s qualifications to serve as deputy FBI director: In Patel’s version of events, Barr was simply one more top bureaucrat bent on foiling Patel’s success as payback for the “mess” he’d exposed in their agency. And if this narrative begins to feel less and less plausible, if Patel’s latest detractors have to date seemed as reliably pro-Trump as Patel himself—well, that just goes to show their cunning.Patel has a talent for casting himself as the ultimate hero or the unjustly persecuted. I have wondered if this is why he chose not to include in his book the events of October 30, 2020—if, in the end, not even he could figure out a way to make himself the martyr of the story.On that Friday, according to multiple reported accounts, SEAL Team 6 was awaiting the Pentagon’s green light on a rescue mission in West Africa. The day before, the administration had learned where gunmen were holding Philip Walton, a 27-year-old American who had been kidnapped that week from his farm near Niger’s border with Nigeria. As multiple agencies now coordinated on final details for the evening operation, the State Department worked to resolve the last outstanding task—securing airspace permission from Nigerian officials. Around noon, Patel called the Pentagon with an update: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he said, had gotten the approval. The mission was a go.The SEALs were close to landing in Nigeria when Defense Secretary Mark Esper discovered that the State Department had not, in fact, secured the overflight clearance, as Patel had claimed. The aircraft were quickly diverted, flying in circles for the next hour as officials scrambled to alert the Nigerian government to their position. With the operation window narrowing, Esper and Pompeo called the Situation Room to put the decision to the president: Either they abort the mission and risk their hostage being killed, or they proceed into foreign airspace and risk their soldiers being shot down.But then, suddenly, the deputy secretary of state was on the line, Esper later wrote in his memoir: They’d been cleared.Soon Walton was reunited with his family.What had happened?Celebratory feelings gave way to anger as officials tried to make sense of Patel’s bad report. According to Esper, Pompeo claimed that at no point had he even spoken with Patel about the mission, much less told him he’d received the airspace rights. Esper wrote that his team suspected that Patel had simply “made the approval story up.”Anthony Tata, the Pentagon official and retired Army general to whom Patel had originally given the green light, confronted Patel in a rage. “You could’ve gotten these guys killed!” Tata shouted, according to two people familiar with the exchange. “What the fuck were you thinking?”Patel’s response was: “If nobody got hurt, who the fuck cares?”Patel denies saying this, or making up the approval story. He “would never jeopardize an operation, American hostages or our soldiers,” he said through his spokesperson. “In every situation, including this one, I followed the chain of command.”But three former senior administration officials independently cited the near catastrophe in West Africa as one of their foremost recollections from Patel’s tenure. They remain unsettled by Patel’s actions in large part because they still have no clue what motivated them. If Patel had in fact just invented the story, as Esper’s team concluded, then why? Was it because the election was in four days, and Patel was simply that impatient to set in motion a final potential victory for Trump, whatever the risk—was it as darkly cynical as that? Did his lack of experience mean he just had no grasp of the consequences?Some people close to the former president privately vent about Patel and whatever they last heard him say on a far-right podcast or at a fundraiser, particularly if it involves some overstatement of his administration activities. The longtime Trump adviser said he had been in Patel’s presence, more than once, when he’d claimed he was the person who “gave the order” for U.S. forces to move in and kill the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019—an operation for which Patel, by his own admission, wasn’t even in the Situation Room. (Asked about this, Patel said through his spokesperson: “Trump made that brave and courageous call.”)One of the former senior administration officials, meanwhile, sent me a photo of what he said was Patel’s challenge coin, a small, customizable medallion for service members and government officials. In addition to a curious image of a drone illuminating (targeting?) a dollar sign in front of the White House, the coin features an assortment of national-security-adjacent terms, including DIRECT ACTION, SANCTIONS, HEZ/IRAN, and CYBER. “It’s just random shit,” the former official said. “Half of this stuff, he wasn’t even involved in.” (Through the spokesperson, Patel neither confirmed nor denied having such a coin.)Yet the prevailing sentiment in Trump’s inner circle, according to the longtime adviser, is that there is no upside to calling out Patel’s exaggerations or lies. By now, this person explained, Trump is entrenched in his view of Patel as a “useful tool.” The former president, the adviser said, understands that “Kash is the one you say to, ‘Hey, I’m not telling you to go break into the DNC. But …’ ”What Trump might also understand is this: For Patel, the urgency of victory in November is personal. He recently described Trump as the candidate “fighting for everybody else’s right to have fame, to have money”—the central prongs of a prosperity that Patel, after nearly a decade in Washington, appears convinced is his due, and of which the leaders of a corrupt system have conspired to deprive him.Little wonder, then, that Steve Bannon mused on his podcast that Patel, far from simply being the person most likely to oversee Trump’s retributive plans in a second term, could have helped inspire them in the first place. “I think President Trump might’ve read Government Gangsters,” Bannon said. “Yeah, look, he probably did,” Patel responded, fetching a copy to display on camera. “That’s probably why it’s a best seller, and he keeps talking about it.”To the extent that Americans might struggle to grasp what any of this has to do with their own life—how a federal agenda of score-settling corresponds to their ability to be famous and make money—Patel has yet to offer a theory. He tends to frame political vengeance as an end in itself. In a second term, Trump’s top law-enforcement and national-security officials would immediately focus on exposing and prosecuting those who “did Russiagate” and are already planning their next “election-rigging scam,” he told Bannon—paying special attention, perhaps, to the 60 names in Patel’s compendium of “Members of the Executive Branch Deep State,” found in Appendix B of Government Gangsters.And then—well, it’s not altogether clear what then. But Patel’s value to Trump has never revolved around precise plans. As Richard Nixon’s plumbers understood, the hallmark of loyalty is a flexible constitution.This article appears in the October 2024 print edition with the headline “The Loyalist.”",

    "text": "On the last anniversary of the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Cambridge, the venerable President Quincy, senior member of the Society, as well as senior alumnus of the University, was received at the dinner with peculiar demonstrations of respect. He replied to these compliments in a speech, and, gracefully claiming the privileges of a literary society, entered at some length into an Apology for Old Age, and, aiding himself by notes in his hand, made a sort of running commentary on Cicero’s chapter “De Senectute.” The character of the speaker, the transparent good faith of his praise and blame, and the naïveté of his eager preference of Cicero’s opinions to King David’s, gave unusual interest to the College festival. It was a discourse full of dignity, honoring him who spoke and those who heard.The speech led me to look over at home — an easy task — Cicero’s famous essay, charming by its uniform rhetorical merit; heroic with Stoical precepts; with a Roman eye to the claims of the State; happiest, perhaps, in his praise of life on the farm; and rising, at the conclusion, to a lofty strain. But he does not exhaust the subject; rather invites the attempt to add traits to the picture from our broader modern life.Cicero makes no reference to the illusions which cling to the element of time, and in which Nature delights. Wellington, in speaking of military men, said, — “What masks are these uniforms to hide cowards! When our journal is published, many statues must come down.” I have often detected the like deception in the cloth shoe, wadded pelisse, wig and spectacles, and padded chair of Age. Nature lends herself to these illusions, and adds dim sight, deafness, cracked voice, snowy hair, short memory, and sleep. These also are masks, and all is not Age that wears them. Whilst we yet call ourselves young, and all our mates are yet youths and boyish, one good fellow in the set prematurely sports a gray or a bald head, which does not impose on us who know how innocent of sanctity or of Platonism he is, but does not less deceive his juniors and the public, who presently distinguish him with a most amusing respect: and this lets us into the secret, that the venerable forms that so awed our childhood were just such impostors. Nature is full of freaks, and now puts an old head on young shoulders, and then a young heart beating under fourscore winters.For if the essence of age is not present, these signs, whether of Art or Nature, are counterfeit and ridiculous: and the essence of age is intellect. Wherever that appears, we call it old. If we look into the eyes of the youngest person, we sometimes discover that here is one who knows already what you would go about with much pains to teach him; there is that in him which is the ancestor of all around him: which fact the Indian Vedas express, when they say, “He that can discriminate is the father of his father.” And in our old British legends of Arthur and the Round-Table, his friend and counsellor, Merlin the Wise, is a babe found exposed in a basket by the river-side, and, though an infant of only a few days, he speaks to those who discover him, tells his name and history, and presently foretells the fate of the by-standers. Wherever there is power, there is age. Don’t be deceived by dimples and curls. I tell you that babe is a thousand years old.Time is, indeed, the theatre and seat of illusion. Nothing is so ductile and elastic. The mind stretches an hour to a century, and dwarfs an age to an hour. Saadi found in a mosque at Damascus an old Persian of a hundred and fifty years who was dying, and was saying to himself, “I said, coming into the world by birth, ‘I will enjoy myself for a few moments.’ Alas! at the variegated table of life I partook of a few mouthfuls, and the Fates said, ‘Enough!’”  That which does not decay is so central and controlling in us, that, as long as one is alone by himself, he is not sensible of the inroads of time, which always begin at the surface-edges. If, on a winter day, you should stand within a bell-glass, the face and color of the afternoon clouds would not indicate whether it were June or January; and if we did not find the reflection of ourselves in the eyes of the young people, we could not know that the century-clock had struck seventy instead of twenty. How many men habitually believe that each chance passenger with whom they converse is of their own age, and presently find it was his father, and not his brother, whom they knew!But, not to press too hard on these deceits and illusions of Nature, which are inseparable from our condition, and looking at age under an aspect more conformed to the common sense, if the question be the felicity of age, I fear the first popular judgments will be unfavorable. From the point of sensuous experience, seen from the streets and markets and the haunts of pleasure and gain, the estimate of age is low, melancholy, and skeptical. Frankly face the facts, and see the result. Tobacco, coffee, alcohol, hashish, prussic acid, strychnine, are weak dilutions: the surest poison is time. This cup, which Nature puts to our lips, has a wonderful virtue, surpassing that of any other draught. It opens the senses, adds power, fills us with exalted dreams, which we call hope, love, ambition, science: especially, it creates a craving for larger draughts of itself. But they who take the larger draughts are drunk with it, lose their stature, strength, beauty, and senses, and end in folly and delirium. We postpone our literary work until we have more ripeness and skill to write, and we one day discover that our literary talent was a youthful effervescence which we have now lost. We had a judge in Massachusetts who at sixty proposed to resign, alleging that he perceived a certain decay in his faculties: he was dissuaded by his friends, on account of the public convenience at that time. At seventy it was hinted to him that it was time to retire; but he now replied, that he thought his judgment as robust, and all his faculties as good as ever they were. But besides the self-deception, the strong and hasty laborers of the street do not work well with the chronic valetudinarian. Youth is everywhere in place. Age, like woman, requires fit surroundings. Age is comely in coaches, in churches, in chairs of state and ceremony, in council-chambers, in courts of justice, and historical societies. Age is becoming in the country. But in the rush and uproar of Broadway, if you look into the faces of the passengers, there is dejection or indignation in the seniors, a certain concealed sense of injury, and the lip made up with a heroic determination not to mind it. Few envy the consideration enjoyed by the oldest inhabitant. We do not count a man’s years, until he has nothing else to count. The vast inconvenience of animal immortality was told in the fable of Tithonus. In short, the creed of the street is, Old Age is not disgraceful, but immensely disadvantageous. Life is well enough, but we shall all be glad to get out of it, and they will all be glad to have us.This is odious on the face of it. Universal convictions are not to be shaken by the whimseys of overfed butchers and firemen, or by the sentimental fears of girls who would keep the infantile bloom on their cheeks. We know the value of experience. Life and art are cumulative; and he who has accomplished something in any department alone deserves to be heard on that subject. A man of great employments and excellent performance used to assure me that he did not think a man worth anything until he was sixty; although this smacks a little of the resolution of a certain “Young Men's Republican Club,” that all men should be held eligible who were under seventy. But in all governments, the councils of power were held by the old; and patricians or patres, senate or senes, seigneurs or seniors, gerousia, the senate of Sparta, the presbytery of the Church, and the like, all signify simply old men.This cynical lampoon is refuted by the universal prayer for long life, which is the verdict of Nature, and justified by all history. We have, it is true, examples of an accelerated pace, by which young men achieved grand works; as in the Macedonian Alexander, in Raffaelle, Shakspeare, Pascal, Burns, and Byron; but these are rare exceptions. Nature, in the main, vindicates her law. Skill to do comes of doing; knowledge comes by eyes always open, and working hands; and there is no knowledge that is not power. And if the life be true and noble, we have quite another sort of seniors than the frowzy, timorous, peevish dotards who are falsely old, — namely, the men who fear no city, but by whom cities stand; who appearing in any street, the people empty their houses to gaze at and obey them: as at “My Cid, with the fleecy heard,” in Toledo; or Bruce, as Barbour reports him; as blind old Dandolo, elected Doge at eighty-four years, storming Constantinople at ninety-four, and after the revolt again victorious, and elected at the age of ninety-six to the throne of the Eastern Empire, which he declined, and died Doge at ninety-seven. We still feel the force of Socrates, “whom well-advised the oracle pronounced wisest of men”; of Archimedes, holding Syracuse against the Romans by his wit, and himself better than all their nation; of Michel Angelo, wearing the four crowns of architecture, sculpture, painting, and poetry; of Galileo, of whose blindness Castelli said, “The noblest eye is darkened that Nature ever made, — an eye that hath seen more than all that went before him, and hath opened the eyes of all that shall come after him”; of Newton, who made an important discovery for every one of his eighty-five years; of Bacon, who “took all knowledge to be his province”; of Fontenelle, “that precious porcelain vase laid up in the centre of France to be guarded with the utmost care for a hundred years”; of Franklin, Jefferson, and Adams, the wise and heroic statesmen; of Washington, the perfect citizen; of Wellington, the perfect soldier; of Goethe, the all-knowing poet; of Humboldt, the encyclopædia of science.Under the general assertion of the well-being of age, we can easily count particular benefits of that condition. It has weathered the perilous capes and shoals in the sea whereon we sail, and the chief evil of life is taken away in removing the grounds of fear. The insurance of a ship expires as she enters the harbor at home. It were strange, if a man should turn his sixtieth year without a feeling of immense relief from the number of dangers he has escaped. When the old wife says, “Take care of that tumor in your shoulder, perhaps it is cancerous,” — he replies, “What if it is?” The humorous thief who drank a pot of beer at the gallows blew off the froth because he had heard it was unhealthy; but it will not add a pang to the prisoner marched out to be shot, to assure him that the pain in his knee threatens mortification. When the pleuro-pneumonia of the cows raged, the butchers said, that, though the acute degree was novel, there never was a time when this disease did not occur among cattle. All men carry seeds of all distempers through life latent, and we die without developing them: such is the affirmative force of the constitution. But if you are enfeebled by any cause, the disease becomes strong. At every stage we lose a foe. At fifty years, ’t is said, afflicted citizens lose their sick-headaches. I hope this hegira is not as movable a feast as that one I annually look for, when the horticulturists assure me that the rosebugs in our gardens disappear on the tenth of July: they stay a fortnight later in mine. But be it as it may with the sick-headache, — ’t is certain that graver headaches and heart-aches are lulled, once for all, as we come up with certain goals of time. The passions have answered their purpose: that slight, but dread overweight, with which, in each instance, Nature secures the execution of her aim, drops off. To keep man in the planet, she impresses the terror of death. To perfect the commissariat, she implants in each a little rapacity to get the supply, and a little oversupply, of his wants. To insure the existence of the race, she reinforces the sexual instinct, at the risk of disorder, grief, and pain. To secure strength, she plants cruel hunger and thirst, which so easily overdo their office, and invite disease. But these temporary stays and shifts for the protection of the young animal are shed as fast as they can be replaced by nobler resources. We live in youth amidst this rabble of passions, quite too tender, quite too hungry and irritable. Later, the interiors of mind and heart open, and supply grander motives. We learn the fatal compensations that wait on every act. Then, — one mischief at a time, — this riotous time-destroying crew disappear.I count it another capital advantage of age, this, that a success more or less signifies nothing. Little by little, it has amassed such a fund of merit, that it can very well afford to go on its credit when it will. When I chanced to meet the poet Wordsworth, then sixty-three years old, he told me, “that he had just had a fall and lost a tooth, and, when his companions were much concerned for the mischance, he had replied, that he was glad it had not happened forty years before.” Well, Nature takes care that we shall not lose our organs forty years too soon. A lawyer argued a cause yesterday in the Supreme Court, and I was struck with a certain air of levity and defiance which vastly became him. Thirty years ago it was a serious concern to him whether his pleading was good and effective. Now it is of importance to his client, but of none to himself. It is long already fixed what he can do and cannot do, and his reputation does not gain or suffer from one or a dozen new performances. If he should, on a new occasion, rise quite beyond his mark, and do somewhat extraordinary and great, that, of course, would instantly tell; but he may go below his mark with impunity, and people will say, “Oh, he had headache,” or, “He lost his sleep for two nights.” What a lust of appearance, what a load of anxieties that once degraded him, he is thus rid of! Every one is sensible of this cumulative advantage in living. All the good days behind him are sponsors, who speak for him when he is silent, pay for him when he has no money, introduce him where he has no letters, and work for him when he sleeps.A third felicity of age is, that it has found expression. Youth suffers not only from ungratified desires, but from powers untried, and from a picture in his mind of a career which has, as yet, no outward reality. He is tormented with the want of correspondence between things and thoughts. Michel Angelo’s head is full of masculine and gigantic figures as gods walking, which make him savage until his furious chisel can render them into marble; and of architectural dreams, until a hundred stone-masons can lay them in courses of travertine. There is the like tempest in every good head in which some great benefit for the world is planted. The throes continue until the child is born. Every faculty new to each man thus goads him and drives him out into doleful deserts, until it finds proper vent. All the functions of human duty irritate and lash him forward, bemoaning and chiding, until they are performed. He wants friends, employment, knowledge, power, house and land, wife and children, honor and fame; he has religious wants, æsthetic wants, domestic, civil, humane wants. One by one, day after day, he learns to coin his wishes into facts. He has his calling, homestead, social connection, and personal power, and thus, at the end of fifty years, his soul is appeased by seeing some sort of correspondence between his wish and his possession. This makes the value of age, the satisfaction it slowly offers to every craving. He is serene who does not feel himself pinched and wronged, but whose condition, in particular and in general, allows the utterance of his mind. In old persons, when thus fully expressed, we often observe a fair, plump, perennial, waxen complexion, which indicates that all the ferment of earlier days has subsided into serenity of thought and behavior.For a fourth benefit, age sets its house in order, and finishes its works, which to every artist is a supreme pleasure. Youth has an excess of sensibility, to which every object glitters and attracts. We leave one pursuit for another, and the young man’s year is a heap of beginnings. At the end of a twelvemonth, he has nothing to show for it, not one completed work. But the time is not lost. Our instincts drove us to hive innumerable experiences, that are yet of no visible value, and which we may keep for twice seven years before they shall be wanted. The best things are of secular growth. The instinct of classifying marks the wise and healthy mind. Linnæus projects his system, and lays out his twenty-four classes of plants, before yet he has found in Nature a single plant to justify certain of his classes. His seventh class has not one. In process of time, he finds with delight the little white Trientalis, the only plant with seven petals and sometimes seven stamens, which constitutes a seventh class in conformity with his system. The conchologist builds his cabinet whilst as yet he has few shells. He labels shelves for classes, cells for species: all but a few are empty. But every year fills some blanks, and with accelerating speed as he becomes knowing and known. An old scholar finds keen delight in verifying all the impressive anecdotes and citations he has met with in miscellaneous reading and hearing, in all the years of youth. We carry in memory important anecdotes, and have lost all clue to the author from whom we had them. We have a heroic speech from Rome or Greece, but cannot fix it on the man who said it. We have an admirable line worthy of Horace, ever and anon resounding in our mind’s ear, but have searched all probable and improbable books for it in vain. We consult the reading men: but, strangely enough, they who know everything know not this. But especially we have a certain insulated thought, which haunts us, but remains insulated and barren. Well, there is nothing for all this but patience and time. Time, yes, that is the finder, the unweariable explorer, not subject to casualties, omniscient at last. The day comes when the hidden author of our story is found; when the brave speech returns straight to the hero who said it; when the admirable verse finds the poet to whom it belongs; and best of all, when the lonely thought, which seemed so wise, yet half-wise, half-thought, because it cast no light abroad, is suddenly matched in our mind by its twin, by its sequence, or next related analogy, which gives it instantly radiating power, and justifies the superstitious instinct with which we had hoarded it. We remember our old Greek Professor at Cambridge, an ancient bachelor, amid his folios, possessed by this hope of completing a task, with nothing to break his leisure after the three hours of his daily classes, yet ever restlessly stroking his leg, and assuring himself “he should retire from the University and read the authors.” In Goethe’s Romance, Makaria, the central figure for wisdom and influence, pleases herself with withdrawing into solitude to astronomy and epistolary correspondence. Goethe himself carried this completion of studies to the highest point. Many of his works hung on the easel from youth to age, and received a stroke in every month or year of his life. A literary astrologer, he never applied himself to any task but at the happy moment when all the stars consented. Bentley thought himself likely to live till fourscore, — long enough to read everything that was worth reading, — “Et tune magna mei sub terris ibit imago.” Much wider is spread the pleasure which old men take in completing their secular affairs, the inventor his inventions, the agriculturist his experiments, and all old men in finishing their houses, rounding their estates, clearing their titles, reducing tangled interests to order, reconciling enmities, and leaving all in the best posture for the future. It must be believed that there is a proportion between the designs of a man and the length of his life: there is a calendar of his years, so of his performances.America is the country of young men, and too full of work hitherto for leisure and tranquillity; yet we have had robust centenarians, and examples of dignity and wisdom. I have lately found in an old note-book a record of a visit to Ex-President John Adams, in 1825, soon after the election of his son to the Presidency. It is but a sketch, and nothing important passed in the conversation; but it reports a moment in the life of a heroic person, who, in extreme old age, appeared still erect, and worthy of his fame.———, Feb., 1825. To-day, at Quincy, with my brother, by invitation of Mr. Adams’s family. The old President sat in a large stuffed arm-chair, dressed in a blue coat, black small-clothes, white stockings, and a cotton cap covered his bald head. We made our compliment, told him he must let us join our congratulations to those of the nation on the happiness of his house. He thanked us, and said, “I am rejoiced, because the nation is happy. The time of gratulation and congratulations is nearly over with me: I am astonished that I have lived to see and know of this event. I have lived now nearly a century: [he was ninety in the following October:] a long, harassed, and distracted life.” — I said, “The world thinks a good deal of joy has been mixed with it.” — “The world does not know,” he replied, “how much toil, anxiety, and sorrow I have suffered.” — I asked if Mr. Adams’s letter of acceptance had been read to him. — “Yes,” he said, and added, “My son has more political prudence than any man that I know who has existed in my time; he never was put off his guard: and I hope he will continue such; but what effect age may work in diminishing the power of his mind, I do not know; it has been very much on the stretch, ever since he was born. He has always been laborious, child and man, from infancy.” — When Mr. J. Q. Adams’s age was mentioned, he said, “He is now fifty-eight, or will be in July”; and remarked that “all the Presidents were of the same age: General Washington was about fifty-eight, and I was about fifty-eight, and Mr. Jefferson, and Mr. Madison, and Mr. Monroe.” — We inquired, when he expected to see Mr. Adams. — He said, “Never: Mr. Adams will not come to Quincy, but to my funeral. It would be a great satisfaction to me to see him, but I don’t wish him to come on my account.” — He spoke of Mr. Lechmere, whom he “well remembered to have seen come down daily, at a great age, to walk in the old townhouse,” — adding, “And I wish I could walk as well as he did. He was Collector of the Customs for many years, under the Royal Government.” — E. said, “I suppose, Sir, you would not have taken his place, even to walk as well as he.” — “No,” he replied, “that was not what I wanted.” — He talked of Whitefield, and “remembered, when he was a Freshman in college, to have come in to the Old South, [I think,] to hear him, but could not get into the house; — I, however, saw him,” he said, “through a window, and distinctly heard all. He had a voice such as I never heard before or since. He cast it out so that you might hear it at the meeting-house, [pointing towards the Quincy meeting-house,] and he had the grace of a dancing-master, of an actor of plays. His voice and manner helped him more than his sermons. I went with Jonathan Sewall.” — “And you were pleased with him, Sir?” — “Pleased! I was delighted beyond measure.” — We asked, if at Whitefield’s return the same popularity continued. — “Not the same fury,” he said, “not the same wild enthusiasm as before, but a greater esteem, as he became more known. He did not terrify, but was admired.”We spent about an hour in his room. He speaks very distinctly for so old a man, enters bravely into long sentences, which are interrupted by want of breath, but carries them invariably to a conclusion, without ever correcting a word.He spoke of the new novels of Cooper, and “Peep at the Pilgrims,” and “Saratoga,” with praise, and named with accuracy the characters in them. He likes to have a person always reading to him, or company talking in his room, and is better the next day after having visitors in his chamber from morning to night.He received a premature report of his son’s election, on Sunday afternoon, without any excitement, and told the reporter he had been hoaxed, for it was not yet time for any news to arrive. The informer, something damped in his heart, insisted on repairing to the meeting-house, and proclaimed it aloud to the congregation, who were so overjoyed that they rose in their seats and cheered thrice. The Reverend Mr. Whitney dismissed them immediately.When life has been well spent, age is a loss of what it can well spare, — muscular strength, organic instincts, gross bulk, and works that belong to these. But the central wisdom, which was old in infancy, is young in fourscore years, and, dropping off obstructions, leaves in happy subjects the mind purified and wise. I have heard that whoever loves is in no condition old. I have heard, that, whenever the name of man is spoken, the doctrine of immortality is announced; it cleaves to his constitution. The mode of it baffles our wit, and no whisper comes to us from the other side. But the inference from the working of intellect, hiving knowledge, hiving skill, — at the end of life just ready to be born, — affirms the inspirations of affection and of the moral sentiment.",

    "author": "Jack London",
    "date": "January 1904 Issue",
    "text": "In a competitive society, where men struggle with one another for food and shelter, what is more natural than that generosity, when it diminishes the food and shelter of men other than he who is generous, should be held an accursed thing? Wise old saws to the contrary, he who takes from a man’s purse takes from his existence. To strike at a man’s food and shelter is to strike at his life, and in a society organized on a tooth-and-nail basis, such an act, performed though it may be under the guise of generosity, is none the less menacing and terrible.It is for this reason that a laborer is so fiercely hostile to another laborer who offers to work for less pay or longer hours. To hold his place (which is to live), he must offset this offer by another equally liberal, which is equivalent to giving away somewhat from the food and shelter he enjoys. To sell his day’s work for two dollars instead of two dollars and a half means that he, his wife, and his children will not have so good a roof over their heads, such warm clothes on their backs, such substantial food in their stomachs. Meat will be bought less frequently, and it will be tougher and less nutritious; stout new shoes will go less often on the children’s feet; and disease and death will be more imminent in a cheaper house and neighborhood.Thus, the generous laborer, giving more of a day’s work for less return (measured in terms of food and shelter), threatens the life of his less generous brother laborer, and, at the best, if he does not destroy that life, he diminishes it. Whereupon the less generous laborer looks upon him as an enemy, and, as men are inclined to do in a tooth-and-nail society, he tries to kill the man who is trying to kill him.When a striker kills with a brick the man who has taken his place, he has no sense of wrong-doing. In the deepest holds of his being, though he does not reason the impulse, he has an ethical sanction. He feels dimly that he has justification, just as the home-defending Boer felt, though more sharply, with each bullet he fired at the invading English. Behind every brick thrown by a striker is the selfish “will to live” of himself and the slightly altruistic will to live of his family. The family-group came into the world before the state-group, and society being still on the primitive basis of tooth and nail, the will to live of the state is not so compelling to the striker as the will to live of his family and himself.In addition to the use of bricks, clubs, and bullets, the selfish laborer finds it necessary to express his feelings in speech. Just as the peaceful country-dweller calls the sea-rover a “pirate,” and the stout burgher calls the man who breaks into his strong-box a “robber,” so the selfish laborer applies the opprobrious epithet “scab” to the laborer who takes from him food and shelter by being more generous in the disposal of his labor-power. The sentimental connotation of scab is as terrific as that of “traitor” or “Judas,” and a sentimental definition would be as deep and varied as the human heart. It is far easier to arrive at what may be called a technical definition, worded in commercial terms, as, for instance, that a scab is one who gives more value for the same price than another.The laborer who gives more time, or strength, or skill, for the same wage, than another, or equal time, or strength, or skill, for a less wage, is a scab. This generousness on his part is hurtful to his fellow laborers, for it compels them to an equal generousness which is not to their liking, and which gives them less of food and shelter. But a word may be said for the scab. Just as his act makes his rivals compulsorily generous, so do they, by fortune of birth and training, make compulsory his act of generousness. He does not scab because he wants to scab. No whim of the spirit, no burgeoning of the heart, leads him to give more of his labor-power than they for a certain sum.It is because he cannot get work on the same terms as they that he is a scab. There is less work than there are men to do work. This is patent, else the scab would not loom so large on the labor-market horizon. Because they are stronger than he, or more skilled, or more fortunate, or more energetic, it is impossible for him to take their places at the same wage. To take their places he must give more value, must work longer hours, or receive a smaller wage. He does so, and he cannot help it, for his will to live is driving him on as well as they are being driven on by theirs, and to live he must win food and shelter, which he can do only by receiving permission to work from some man who owns a bit of land or piece of machinery. And to receive permission from this man, he must make the transaction profitable for him.Viewed in this light, the scab who gives more labor-power for a certain price than his fellows is not so generous after all. He is no more generous with his energy than the chattel slave and the convict laborer, who, by the way, are the almost perfect scabs. They give their labor-power for about the minimum possible price. But, within limits, they may loaf and malinger, and, as scabs, are exceeded by the machine, which never loafs and malingers, and which is the ideally perfect scab.It is not nice to be a scab. Not only is it not in good social taste and comradeship, but, from the standpoint of food and shelter, it is bad business policy. Nobody desires to scab, to give most for least. The ambition of every individual is quite the opposite,—to give least for most; and as a result, living in a tooth-and-nail society, battle royal is waged by the ambitious individuals. But in its most salient aspect, that of the struggle over the division of a joint-product, it is no longer a battle between individuals, but between groups of individuals. Capital and labor apply themselves to raw material, make something useful out of it, add to its value, and then proceed to quarrel over the division of the added value. Neither cares to give most for least. Each is intent on giving less than the other and on receiving more.Labor combines into its unions; capital into partnerships, associations, corporations, and trusts. A group-struggle is the result, in which the individuals, as individuals, play no part. The Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, for instance, serves notice on the Master Builders’ Association that it demands an increase of the wage of its members from $3.50 a day to $4.00, and a Saturday half-holiday without pay. This means that the carpenters are trying to give less for more. Where they received $21.00 for six full days, they are endeavoring to get $22.00 for five days and a half,—that is, they will work half a day less each week and receive a dollar more.Also, they expect the Saturday half-holiday to give work to one additional man for each eleven previously employed. This last affords a splendid example of the development of the group idea. In this particular struggle the individual has no chance at all for life. The individual carpenter would be crushed like a mote by the Master Builders’ Association, and like a mote the individual master builder would be crushed by the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners.In the group-struggle over the division of the joint-product, labor utilizes the union with its two great weapons,—the strike and boycott; while capital utilizes the trust and the association, the weapons of which are the blacklist, the lockout, and the scab. The scab is by far the most formidable weapon of the three. He is the man who breaks strikes and causes all the trouble. Without him there would be no trouble, for the strikers are willing to remain out peacefully and indefinitely so long as other men are not in their places, and so long as the particular aggregation of capital with which they are fighting is eating its head off in enforced idleness.But both warring groups have reserve weapons up their sleeves. Were it not for the scab, these weapons would not be brought into play. But the scab takes the places of the strikers, who begin at once to wield a most powerful weapon,—terrorism. The will to live of the scab recoils from the menace of broken bones and violent death. With all due respect to the labor leaders, who are not to be blamed for volubly asseverating otherwise, terrorism is a well-defined and eminently successful policy of the labor unions. It has probably won them more strikes than all the rest of the weapons in their arsenal. This terrorism, however, must be clearly understood. It is directed solely against the scab, placing him in such fear for life and limb as to drive him out of the contest. But when terrorism gets out of hand and inoffensive non-combatants are injured, law and order threatened, and property destroyed, it becomes an edged tool that cuts both ways. This sort of terrorism is sincerely deplored by the labor leaders, for it has probably lost them as many strikes as have been lost by any other single cause.The scab is powerless under terrorism. As a rule he is not so good or gritty a man as the men he is displacing, and he lacks their fighting organization. He stands in dire need of stiffening and backing. His employers, the capitalists, draw their two remaining weapons, the ownership of which is debatable, but which they for the time being happen to control. These two weapons may be called the political and judicial machinery of society. When the scab crumples up and is ready to go down before the fists, bricks, and bullets of the labor-group, the capitalist-group puts the police and soldiers into the field, and begins a general bombardment of injunctions. Victory usually follows, for the labor-group cannot withstand the combined assault of gatling guns and injunctions.But it has been noted that the ownership of the political and judicial machinery of society is debatable. In the Titanic struggle over the division of the joint-product, each group reaches out for every available weapon. Nor are they blinded by the smoke of conflict. They fight their battles as coolly and collectedly as ever battles were fought on paper. The capitalist-group has long since realized the immense importance of controlling the political and judicial machinery of society. Taught by gatlings and injunctions, which have smashed many an otherwise successful strike, the labor-group is beginning to realize that it all depends upon who is behind and who is before those weapons. And he who knows the labor-movement knows that there is slowly growing up and being formulated a clear, definite policy for the capture of the political and judicial machinery.This is the terrible spectre which Mr. John Graham Brooks sees looming portentously over the twentieth-century world. No man may boast a more intimate knowledge of the labor-movement than he, and he reiterates again and again the dangerous likelihood of the whole labor-group capturing the political machinery of society. As he says in his recent book*:This struggle not to be a scab, to avoid giving more for less, and to succeed in giving less for more, is more vital than it would appear on the surface. The capitalist and labor groups are locked together in desperate battle, and neither side is swayed by moral considerations more than skin-deep. The labor-group hires business agents, lawyers, and organizers; and is beginning to intimidate legislators by the strength of its solid vote, and more directly, in the near future, it will attempt to control legislation by capturing it bodily through the ballot-box. On the other hand, the capitalist-group, numerically weaker, hires newspapers, universities, and legislatures, and strives to bend to its need all the forces which go to mould public opinion.The only honest morality displayed by either side is white-hot indignation at the iniquities of the other side. The striking teamster complacently takes a scab driver into an alley and with an iron bar breaks his arms so that he can drive no more, but cries out to high heaven for justice when the capitalist breaks his skull by means of a club in the hands of a policeman. Nay, the members of a union will declaim in impassioned rhetoric for the God-given right of an eight-hour day, and at the time be working their own business agent seventeen hours out of the twenty-four.A capitalist, such as the late Collis P. Huntington, and his name is Legion, after a long life spent in buying the aid of countless legislatures, will wax virtuously wrathful and condemn in unmeasured terms “the dangerous tendency of crying out to the government for aid” in the way of labor legislation. Without a quiver, a member of the capitalist-group will run tens of thousands of pitiful child-laborers through his life-destroying cotton factories, and weep maudlin and Constitutional tears over one scab hit in the back with a brick. He will drive a “compulsory” free contract with an unorganized laborer on the basis of a starvation wage, saying, “Take it or leave it,” knowing that to leave it means to die of hunger; and in the next breath, when the organizer entices that laborer into a union, will storm patriotically about the inalienable rights of all men to work. In short, the chief moral concern of either side is with the morals of the other side. They are not in the business for their moral welfare, but to achieve the enviable position of the non-scab who gets more than he gives.But there is more to the question than has yet been discussed. The labor scab is no more detestable to his brother laborers than is the capitalist scab to his brother capitalists. A capitalist may get most for least in dealing with his laborers, and in so far be a non-scab; but at the same time, in his dealings with his fellow capitalists, he may give most for least and be the very worst kind of scab. The most heinous crime an employer of labor can commit is to scab on his fellow employers of labor. Just as the individual laborers have organized into groups to protect themselves from the peril of the scab laborer, so have the employers organized into groups to protect themselves from the peril of the scab employer. The employers’ federations, associations, and trusts are nothing more or less than unions. They are organized to destroy scabbing amongst themselves and to encourage scabbing amongst others. For this reason they pool interests, determine prices, and present an unbroken and aggressive front to the labor-group.As has been said before, nobody likes to play the compulsorily generous role of scab. It is a bad business proposition on the face of it. And it is patent that there would be no capitalist scabs if there were not more capital than there is work for capital to do. When there are enough factories in existence to supply, with occasional stoppages, a certain commodity, the building of new factories, by a rival concern, for the production of that commodity, is plain advertisement that that capital is out of a job. The first act of this new aggregation of capital will be to cut prices, to give more for less; in short, to scab, to strike at the very existence of the less generous aggregation of capital, the work of which it is trying to do.No scab capitalist strives to give more for less for any other reason than that he hopes, by undercutting a competitor and driving that competitor out of the market, to get that market and its profits for himself. His ambition is to achieve the day when he shall stand alone in the field both as buyer and seller, when he will be the royal non-scab buying most for least, selling least for most, and reducing all about him, the small buyers and sellers (the consumers and the laborers), to a general condition of scabdom. This, for example, has been the history of Mr. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Company. Through all the sordid economies of scabdom he has passed until to-day he is a most regal non-scab. However, to continue in this enviable position, he must be prepared at a moment's notice to go scabbing again. And he is prepared. Whenever a competitor arises, Mr. Rockefeller changes about from giving least for most, and gives most for least with such a vengeance as to drive the competitor out of existence.The banded capitalists discriminate against a scab capitalist by refusing him trade advantages, and by combining against him in most relentless fashion. The banded laborers, discriminating against a scab laborer in more primitive fashion, with a club, are no more merciless than the banded capitalists.Mr. Casson tells of a New York capitalist, who withdrew from the Sugar Union several years ago and became a scab. He was worth something like twenty millions of dollars. But the Sugar Union, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Railroad Union and several others, beat him to his knees till he cried enough. So frightfully did they beat him that he was obliged to turn over to his creditors his home, his chickens, and his gold watch. In point of fact, he was as thoroughly bludgeoned by the Federation of Capitalist Unions as ever scab workman was bludgeoned by a labor union. The intent in either case is the same, to destroy the scab’s producing power. The labor scab with concussion of the brain is put out of business, and so is the capitalist scab who has lost all his dollars down to his chickens and his watch.But the role of scab passes beyond the individual. Just as individuals scab on other individuals, so do groups scab on other groups. And the principle involved is precisely the same as in the case of the simple labor scab. A group, in the nature of its organization, is often compelled to give most for least, and, so doing, to strike at the life of another group. At the present moment all Europe is appalled by that colossal scab, the United States. And Europe is clamorous with agitation for a Federation of National Unions to protect her from the United States. It may be noted, in passing, that in its prime essentials this agitation in no wise differs from the trade union agitation among workmen in any industry. The trouble is caused by the scab who is giving most for least. The result of the American Scab's nefarious actions will be to strike at the food and shelter of Europe. The way for Europe to protect herself is to quit bickering among her parts and to form a union against the Scab. And if the union is formed, armies and navies may be expected to be brought into play in fashion similar to the bricks and clubs in ordinary labor struggles.In this connection, and as one of many walking delegates for the nations, M. Leroy-Beaulieu, the noted French economist, may well be quoted. In a letter to the Vienna Tageblatt, he advocates an economic alliance among the Continental nations for the purpose of barring out American goods. an economic alliance, in his own language, \"which may possibly and desirably develop into a political alliance.\"It will be noted in the utterances of the Continental walking delegates that, one and all, they leave England out of the proposed union. And in England herself the feeling is growing that her days are numbered if she cannot unite for offense and defense with the great American Scab. As Andrew Carnegie said some time ago, \"The only course for Great Britain seems to be reunion with her grandchild, or sure decline to a secondary place, and then to comparative insignificance in the future annals of the English-speaking race.\"Cecil Rhodes, speaking of what would have obtained but for the pig-headedness of George III., and of what will obtain when England and the United States are united, said, “No cannon would . . . be fired on either hemisphere but by permission of the English race.” It would seem that England, fronted by the hostile Continental Union and flanked by the great American Scab, has nothing left but to join with the Scab and play the historic labor-role of armed Pinkerton. Granting the words of Cecil Rhodes, the United States would be enabled to scab without let or hindrance on Europe, while England, as professional strike-breaker and policeman, destroyed the unions and kept order.All this may appear fantastic and erroneous, but there is in it a soul of truth vastly more significant than it may seem. Civilization may be expressed to-day in terms of trade unionism. Individual struggles have largely passed away, but group struggles increase prodigiously. And the things for which the groups struggle are the same as of old. Shorn of all subtleties and complexities, the chief struggle of men, and of groups of men, is for food and shelter. And, as of old they struggled with tooth and nail, so to-day they struggle, with teeth and nails elongated into armies and navies, machines, and economic advantages.Under the definition that a scab is one who gives more value for the same price than another, it would seem that society can be generally divided into the two classes of the scabs and the non-scabs. But on closer investigation, however, it will be seen that the non-scab is almost a vanishing quantity. In the social jungle everybody is preying upon everybody else. As in the case of Mr. Rockefeller, he who was a scab yesterday is a non-scab to-day, and to-morrow may be a scab again.The woman stenographer or bookkeeper who receives forty dollars per month where a man was receiving seventy-five is a scab. So is the woman who does a man’s work at a weaving machine, and the child who goes into the mill or factory. And the father, who is scabbed out of work by the wives and children of other men, sends his own wife and children to scab in order to save himself.When a publisher offers an author better royalties than other publishers have been paying him, he is scabbing on those other publishers. The reporter on a newspaper who feels he should be receiving a larger salary for his work, says so, and is shown the door, is replaced by a reporter who is a scab; whereupon, when the belly-need presses, the displaced reporter goes to another paper and scabs himself. The minister who hardens his heart to a call, and waits for a certain congregation to offer him say five hundred a year more, often finds himself scabbed upon by another and more impecunious minister; and the next time it is his turn to Scab while a brother minister is hardening his heart to a call. The scab is everywhere. The professional strike-breakers, who, as a class, receive large wages, will scab on one another, while scab unions are even formed to prevent scabbing upon scabs.There are non-scabs, but they are usually born so, and are protected by the whole might of society in the possession of their food and shelter. King Edward is such a type, as are all individuals who receive hereditary food-and-shelter privileges, such as the present Duke of Bedford, for instance, who yearly receives $75,000 from the good people of London because some former king gave some former ancestor of his the market privileges of Covent Garden. The irresponsible rich are likewise non-scabs, and, by them is meant that coupon-clipping class which hires its managers and brains to invest the money usually left it by its ancestors.Outside these lucky creatures, all the rest, at one time or another in their lives, are scabs, at one time or another are engaged in giving more for a certain price than any one else. The meek professor in some endowed institution, by his meek suppression of his convictions, is giving more for his salary than the other more outspoken professor gave, whose chair he occupies. And when a political party dangles a full dinner-pail in the eyes of the toiling masses. it is offering more for a vote than the dubious dollar of the opposing party. Even a money-lender is not above taking a slightly lower rate of interest and saying nothing about it.Because the British laborer is disinclined to scab, that is, because he restricts his output in order to give less for the wage he receives, it is to a certain extent made possible for the American capitalist, who receives a less restricted output from his laborers, to play the scab on the English capitalist. As a result of this (of course, combined with other causes), the American capitalist and the Amencan laborer are striking at the food and shelter of the English capitalist and laborer.The English laborer is starving to-day because, among other things, he is not a scab. He practices the policy of “Ca’ Canny,” which may be defined as “go easy.” In order to get most for least, in many trades he performs but from one fourth to one sixth of the labor he is well able to perform. An instance of this is found in the building of the Westinghouse Electric Works at Manchester. The British limit per man was 400 bricks per day. The Westinghouse Company imported a “driving” American contractor aided by half-a-dozen “driving” American foremen, and the British bricklayer swiftly attained an average of 1800 bricks per day, with a maximum of 2500 bricks for the plainest work.But the British laborer’s policy of Ca’ Canny, which is the very honorable one of giving least for most, and which is likewise the policy of the English capitalist, is nevertheless frowned upon by the English capitalist whose business existence is threatened by the great American Scab. From the rise of the factory system, the English capitalist gladly embraced the opportunity, wherever he found it, of giving least for most. He did it all over the world wherever he enjoyed a market monopoly, and he did it at home, with the laborers employed in his mills, destroying them like flies till prevented, within limits, by the passage of the Factory Acts. Some of the proudest fortunes of England to-day may trace their origin to the giving of least for most to the miserable slaves of the factory towns. But at the present time the English capitalist is outraged because his laborers are employing against him precisely the same policy he employed against them, and which he would employ again did the chance present itself.Yet Ca’ Canny is a disastrous thing to the British laborer. It has driven ship-building from England to Scotland, bottle-making from Scotland to Belgium, flint-glass-making from England to Germany, and to-day it is steadily driving industry after industry to other countries. A correspondent from Northampton wrote not long ago: “Factories are working half and third time.... There is no strike, there is no real labor trouble, but the masters and men are alike suffering from sheer lack of employment. Markets which were once theirs are now American.” It would seem that the unfortunate British laborer is 'twixt the devil and the deep sea. If he gives most for least, he faces a frightful slavery such as marked the beginning of the factory system. If he gives least for most, he drives industry away to other countries, and has no work at all.But the union laborers of the United States have nothing to boast of, while, according to their trade-union ethics, they have a great deal of which to be ashamed. They passionately preach short hours and big wages, the shorter the hours and the bigger the wages the better. Their hatred for a scab is as terrible as the hatred of a patriot for a traitor, of a Christian for a Judas. And in the face of all this they are as colossal scabs as the United States is a colossal scab. For all of their boasted unions and high labor-ideals, they are about the most thorough-going scabs on the planet.Receiving $4.50 per day, because of his proficiency and immense working power, the American laborer has been known to scab upon scabs (so called) who took his place and received only $.90 per day for a longer day. In this particular instance, five Chinese coolies, working longer hours, gave less value for the price received from their employer than did one American laborer.It is upon his brother laborers overseas that the American laborer most outrageously scabs. As Mr. Casson has shown, an English nailmaker gets $3.00 per week, while an American nailmaker gets $30.00. But the English worker turns out 200 pounds of nails per week, while the American turns out 5500 pounds. If he were as \"fair\" as his English brother, other things being equal, he would be receiving, at the English worker's rate of pay. $82.50. As it is, he is scabbing upon his English brother to the tune of $79.50 per week. Dr. Schultze-Gaevernitz has shown that a German weaver produces 466 yards of cotton a week at a cost of .303 per yard, while an American weaver produces 1200 yards at a cost of .02 per yard.But, it may be objected, a great part of this is due to the more improved American machinery. Very true; but, none the less, a great part is still due to the superior energy, skill, and willingness of the American laborer. The English laborer is faithful to the policy of Ca’ Canny. He refuses point blank to get the work out of a machine that the New World scab gets out of a machine. Mr. Maxim, observing a wasteful hand-labor process in his English factory, invented a machine which he proved capable of displacing several men. But workman after workman was put at the machine, and without exception they turned out neither more nor less than a workman turned out by hand. They obeyed the mandate of the union and went easy, while Mr. Maxim gave up in despair. Nor will the British workman run machines at as high speed as the American, nor will he run so many. An American workman will “give equal attention simultaneously to three, four, or six machines or tools, while the British workman is compelled by his trade union to limit his attention to one, so that employment may be given to half-a-dozen men.”But to scabbing, no blame attaches itself anywhere. All the world is a scab, and with rare exceptions, all the people in it are scabs. The strong, capable workman gets a job and holds it because of his strength and capacity. And he holds it because out of his strength and capacity he gives a better value for his wage than does the weaker and less capable workman. Therefore he is scabbing upon his weaker and less capable brother workman. This is incontrovertible. He is giving more value for the price paid by the employer.The superior workman scabs upon the inferior workman because he is so constituted and cannot help it. The one, by fortune of birth and upbringing, is strong and capable; the other, by fortune of birth and upbringing, is not so strong or capable. It is for the same reason that one country scabs upon another. That country which has the good fortune to possess great natural resources, a finer sun and soil, unhampering institutions, and a deft and intelligent labor class and capitalist class, is bound to scab upon a country less fortunately situated. It is the good fortune of the United States that is making her the colossal scab, just as it is the good fortune of one man to be born with a straight back while his brother is born with a hump.It is not good to give most for least, not good to be a scab. The word has gained universal opprobrium. On the other hand, to be a non-scab, to give least for most, is universally branded as stingy, selfish, and unchristian-like. So all the world, like the British workman, is ‘twixt the devil and the deep sea. It is treason to one’s fellows to scab, it is treason to God and unchristian-like not to scab.Since to give least for most and to give most for least are universally bad, what remains? Equity remains, which is to give like for like, the same for the same, neither more nor less. But this equity, society, as at present constituted, cannot give. It is not in the nature of present-day society for men to give like for like, the same for the same. And as long as men continue to live in this competitive society, struggling tooth and nail with one another for food and shelter, (which is to struggle tooth and nail with one another for life), that long will the scab continue to exist. His will to live will force him to exist. He may be flouted and jeered by his brothers, he may be beaten with bricks and clubs by the men who by superior strength and capacity scab upon him as he scabs upon them by longer hours and smaller wages, but through it all he will persist, going them one better, and giving a bit more of most for least than they are giving.*Footnote refers to John Graham Brooks’ The Social Unrest.

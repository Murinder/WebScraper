    "text": "If there’s one thing missing from the modern cinematic landscape, it’s the real, ineffable charm that made no-name ingenues into overnight sensations. Seldom do we see the meteoric rise of someone whose it-factor is so undeniable that they can maintain their ascent after the shine of a viral TikTok dance or the precocious sparkle of a stolen scene wears off. The early 2000s were full of these entertainers, ones who could draw your gaze from across the room just by locking eyes with the cover of a “Vanity Fair” young Hollywood issue. Raven Symoné! Hilary Duff! Amanda Bynes! But there were none so effervescent as Lindsay Lohan, who, from her breakout role in “The Parent Trap” at age 12, proved she had more talent in her pinky than most young stars actors ever display in their entire careers.\nSince her initial climb to stardom, Lohan has experienced her fair share of well-documented stumbles. But the worst mistakes weren’t enough to deplete the public’s goodwill — not entirely, at least. And after going through hell to mount a successful comeback, Lohan is far past the point of needing to prove herself to anyone. After moving semi-permanently to Dubai to escape the prying lenses of the paparazzi who had a bounty on her darkest days since she was still a teenager, the once-troubled star rerouted her life and regained control of her narrative. She got married, had a child, and began to act again at her own pace, starting with the 2022 Netflix holiday film “Falling for Christmas” before inking a two-picture deal with the streamer soon after. By anyone’s standards, Lohan took the raw deal she was given as a child star whose popularity exploded in the brutal celebrity culture of the early aughts and transformed it into an impressive second act.\nBut you wouldn’t know that by tapping into any of the press that Lohan has done for her latest Netflix film, “Our Little Secret.” In junkets and talk show interviews, the conversation inevitably turns to Lohan’s earlier work in films like “Mean Girls” and “Freaky Friday” (the latter of which will receive a sequel, “Freakier Friday,” in 2025). Those are safe places to land, topics that journalists and hosts can mine for some clickbait nostalgia or audience applause, but focusing so heavily on the past does little to serve this pivotal moment in Lohan’s career.\nAfter “Falling for Christmas,” it was plain to see that the Lohan Renaissance — or “Lohanaissance” as many (or, maybe, just me) dubbed it — was well underway. The Disney star who consistently outshined and outacted her peers was happy, healthy and ready to sharpen any performing skills that may have dulled during years when work was sparse. The public is rooting for Lohan in a way they haven’t in two decades. And though “Our Little Secret” is the best of Lohan’s trio of Netflix offerings, it should be both a temporary cap on her rom-coms and a springboard for something better suited to her broad array of talents.\nKatie Baker, Ian Harding and Lindsay Lohan in \"Our Little Secret\" (Netflix)\nThat’s not to say that “Our Little Secret” isn’t enjoyable all on its own, only that it’s become wearying to watch Lohan confined to the limits of a holiday movie made for a streamer. The film’s conceit isn’t exactly novel, either. In the movie, Lohan plays Avery, a young, business-minded woman who dumps her boyfriend Logan (Ian Harding) for a big job in London. Ten years after their trainwreck breakup, Avery tags along with her new beau Cameron (Jon Rudnitsky) for his big family Christmas, where she thinks the biggest hurdle will be impressing Cameron’s uptight, holiday-obsessed mother, Erica (Kristin Chenoweth). But a much larger obstacle waits just behind Erica’s wreath-and-string-light-covered entryway: Logan, with Cameron’s sister Cassie (Katie Baker) on his arm.\nFirst-time screenwriter Hailey DeDominicis draws from familiar setups for her batch of holiday hijinks. But her droll, realistic script and the film’s reasonably stacked cast (for a streaming Christmas movie, anyway) keep “Our Little Secret” from feeling too conventional. Lohan’s first two Netflix films, “Falling for Christmas” and the godawful “Irish Wish,” had cheesy dialogue and slight magical elements that made both films feel wholly undeserving of Lohan’s singular presence. But in “Our Little Secret,” Lohan thankfully isn’t beholden to any of the kitsch that plagued her prior Netflix movies. The romantic subplot is predictable but sweet, and the humor is legitimately clever, letting Lohan remind us that her comedic chops extend far beyond physical humor. She’s still got the preternatural charisma that made audiences fall in love with her, and it hasn’t been this apparent in years.\nDan Bucatinsky, Kristin Chenoweth, Jake Brennan, Katie Baker, Jon Rudintsky in \"Our Little Secret\" (Netflix)While “Our Little Secret” is a decent movie — undoubtedly the best of Lohan’s three Netflix films — it’s only a sizzle reel compared to what she could do next. Nostalgia is a potent drug, and Lohan would do well to capitalize on the goodwill she’s built over the last couple of years, which will only keep stacking with “Freakier Friday” on the horizon. The masses are eager to see their favorite starlet shine bright again, and it’s time to pursue a project that isn’t tailor-made for Jimmy Fallon’s lowball questions and dated references.\nBut what kind of project might that be, exactly? Lohan’s filmography offers a fair amount of underrated movies from which she could draw inspiration when looking toward the future. Assuming that there won’t be a “Freakiest Friday” (although I’d be happy to sell the rights to the name to the House of Mouse for a cool $2 million), Lohan is safe to step into something a bit more adult. If we look back to the mid-2000s when Lohan was making her first break from the Disney machine, turns in “A Prairie Home Companion” and “Georgia Rule” had Hollywood legends Meryl Streep and Jane Fonda singing her praises; the former even posed alongside Lohan on a “W Magazine” cover that same year, suggesting that Lohan had the potential to follow in Streep’s footsteps.\nWhile one might argue that a career of the same magnitude as Streep’s is far behind Lohan, there’s no reason to believe that a solid set of dramatic roles couldn’t be in her future. Both “Georgia Rule” and “A Prairie Home Companion” leveraged Lohan’s wide-eyed ingenue status, but consider how actors like Natasha Lyonne and Winona Ryder burst back onto the scene in major ways after achieving fame around the same age as Lohan. Both women had their struggles made public and faced relentless scrutiny, only to step back from the limelight until they found projects that spoke to their skill sets.\nAside from that uncanny comic timing, Lohan is gifted with a screen presence that few of her contemporaries could replicate, making her perfect for scene-stealing supporting roles. A smaller part is nothing to scoff at, either. Margot Robbie managed to be the best part of Wes Anderson’s “Asteroid City” with nothing but a brief, moving monologue in a scene that held the key to the entire film. With her signature husky voice and confident delivery, there’s no reason Lohan wouldn’t be the perfect choice for a similar bit part.\nWell, there is one reason. To fully regain movie star status (if that is what she wants, that is), Lindsay Lohan has to stop being Lindsay Lohan. She has to find a connection to a character that will allow her to disappear into a role entirely. All her years as a tabloid target have made that a lofty task for Lohan, but it’s not an impossible goal. Take her starring role in Paul Schrader’s derided-yet-misunderstood 2013 L.A. noir “The Canyons.” As the bored trust fund kid Tara, Lohan drew from her experiences withering away in the California sun to craft a character who was detestable but always sympathetic. Despite the film’s tortured production, Lohan won Schrader’s praises. Her performance is perhaps the sole reason that the film has achieved cult status, mirrored in the equally lovable mess that is 2007’s “I Know Who Killed Me,” which wouldn’t be half as impressive without its enthusiastic star.\nBut a full transformation may already be imminent, with Lohan recently confirming that she’s working on a biopic of Ann-Margret, who gave Lohan her blessing to play her in the movie. A film about one of cinema’s greatest dancers could be the ideal role for Lohan at this stage, letting her flex her physical prowess and dramatic chops in equal measure. But whether the biopic ends up being “Maria” good or “Back to Black” bad, it’s nice to see Lohan in the Hollywood mix again. Let’s just hope her massive potential doesn’t have to be our little secret much longer.",

    "text": "The era of Prohibition, which spanned 13 years in the United States before its repeal on December 5, 1933, left a lasting legacy that went far beyond dry laws. It catalyzed the rise of organized crime, laid the blueprint for Las Vegas (inspired by Tijuana’s bustling strip of businesses where Americans could drink and gamble freely), introduced the Caesar Salad, and, perhaps most notably, birthed the modern cocktail movement.\nWhile cocktails predated Prohibition, it was during this era that their purpose shifted. The decline in alcohol quality due to rampant bootlegging forced bartenders to mask the harsh flavors of bathtub gin and moonshine. From this period, innovation boomed, resulting in timeless classics like the Bee’s Knees, French 75 and Sidecar.\nThough the United States’ experiment with Prohibition didn’t extend south of the border, its cultural impact reverberated there, influencing Mexico’s cocktail scene in ways that endure today. Nowhere is this more evident than at Rayo, a bar tucked inside a Porfirian-style mansion in Mexico City, where history and innovation collide in a singular drinking experience.\nIf you don't know where you’re going, it’s easy to miss the narrow entry to Rayo.\nLook for a cast iron medallion of a bulldog on the building’s exterior to indicate you’re in the right place. It’s the first sign that Rayo has layers of depth and complexity that reveal themselves the closer you look.\n“Our aim was to create a place where guests feel a genuine sense of Mexican hospitality and history through each drink,” says Victor Garibay, founder and owner of Rayo. “When guests leave, we hope they feel like they’ve connected with Mexico on a deeper level, not just through the flavors but through the stories and symbols that make up each part of Rayo.”\nAfter checking in, patrons are guided to an antique elevator, where they’re served espresso shots for the short ride to the third floor. The doors open to the dimly lit floor where a neon sign in the shape of a lightning bolt illuminates the space. Once seated, guests are presented with a wooden box that includes 10 sample tinctures of their “Mexico Through the Senses” cocktail menu.\nThis tasting ritual encourages exploration before committing to a full-sized drink (with the disclaimer that some drinks will vary in taste due to prep).\n“The menu celebrates so many different regions, weaving together the country’s spirit-making traditions with modern, playful storytelling elements,” says Garibay. “Each cocktail, titled by number, has its own narrative, rooted in cultural history. The #1 Cocktail, for example, is inspired by carne en su jugo, a traditional beef stew from Northern Jalisco. It’s made with a lacto-ferment of the stew’s vegetables, beef-and-bacon-infused mezcal, and garnished with a beef tendon chicharrón.\"\nGaribay also points to Cocktail #2, which pays homage to the cultural significance of corn. It features a false corn garnish made from leftover sweet corn scraps. Emulsified elote batter is molded to resemble corn on the cob.\nThe meticulous thought behind each drink extends beyond flavor.\nThe bar amplifies the experience from the moment its name is spoken, with subtle, symbolic details woven throughout its design. Rayo draws its name from the Aztec myth of the goddess Mayahuel, who descended to Earth with her lover, Quetzalcoatl. Their forbidden union incurred the wrath of Mayahuel's grandmother, who destroyed the lovers after they transformed into an agave plant. In his grief, Quetzalcoatl planted Mayahuel's remains, from which a maguey plant grew. When lightning struck the plant, its sap began to flow, symbolizing her transformation into the source of spirits like mezcal, tequila and sotol. This lightning bolt, a symbol of life, is called rayo in Spanish and is subtly incorporated into both the menu and the venue’s design.\nThe box that holds the 10 tinctures serves as a showcase of Mexico’s regional craftsmanship. Made from barro negro — the black clay synonymous with Oaxacan artistry — it features designs representing four Mexican regions known for their spirit-making traditions: Oaxaca, Michoacán, Jalisco and Chihuahua. These regions are the origins of the spirits highlighted in the menu’s cocktails: mezcal from Oaxaca, charanda from Michoacán, tequila from Jalisco, and sotol from Chihuahua. Each side of the box pays homage not only to traditional craftsmanship, but also to the unique spirit that defines its respective region.\n“These touches are our way of bringing those regions to life in a contemporary setting,” says Garibay. “We want Rayo to be a place where people can not only drink well but also gain a greater appreciation for the Mexican way of life and the depth of its culture.”\nOne standout creation at Rayo is the Avery Milk Punch, a drink that Garibay says connects the bar’s location to its own storied past.\n“We found an old plaque on the building with a bulldog named ‘Avery’ and the phrase ‘Teeth Talk,’” recalls Garibay. “After digging into the building’s history, we found a connection to the Avery Company, a tractor manufacturer from Illinois in the 1800s. One of the building’s past owners had imported an Avery tractor and later turned this space into a horchatería, which we believe became a speakeasy during Prohibition.”\nProhibition in Mexico was not as widespread or long-lasting as its cousin up north, but it did require the same circumventing of laws in order to be able to serve alcohol within city limits. The Avery Milk Punch is designed to acknowledge this past. It uses Mexican moonshine with fig, green apple, lemon, milk and vanilla tea — ingredients that would’ve been common in the early 19th century.\nThe drink, served in a tea cup, is garnished with Gorgonzola-stuffed olives (on the recommendation of a cheese expert with whom the bar partnered) for an umami finish.\nGaribay sees Rayo as part of a broader movement celebrating Mexican heritage in unexpected ways.\n“The city has always had this magnetic energy, and now it’s being recognized as a global, cultural epicenter,” Garibay said. “What excites me most is that the city is evolving in a way that celebrates Mexico’s roots. Whether it’s through cuisine, art, or cocktails, we’re seeing the re-emergence of traditional techniques and ingredients used in unexpected and exciting ways. I’m proud that Rayo is part of this moment and contributing to a global appreciation for the depth and diversity of Mexican culture.”\nRayo may not be a speakeasy in the traditional sense, but its hidden entrance, historical references, and reverence for the past create a uniquely immersive experience — one that invites guests to savor not just the cocktails but the rich, layered stories behind them.",

    "title": "Joe Biden’s Hunter lesson: The political high road is a mirage",
    "author": "Lucian K. Truscott IV",
    "date": "December 3, 2",
    "text": "How quickly we forget. On the morn of President Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter, there is nary a column inch about who Trump pardoned before he left office. All the pearl clutchers — elected Democrats and liberal political commentators alike – have been lamenting that Biden “lied” or “broke his promise” not to pardon his son.  Meanwhile, Trump’s pardons of multiple figures who could incriminate him criminally or merely for political corruption are going unmentioned. So, let’s take a little trip down the Trump pardon memory hole:\nWe will start with the odious Paul Manafort. He had all kinds of connections to possible Trump crimes. Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska hired him to run his influence operation in Ukraine, which included lobbying for an accused murderer seeking investment opportunities for his corrupt company, as well as running the political campaign of Viktor Yanukovych, the corrupt Ukrainian politician who would be elected president and then ousted in a peaceful revolution.  Manafort met repeatedly with a Russian GRU agent working for Deripaska, Konstantin Kilimnik, while serving as Trump’s 2016 campaign manager and even transferred Trump polling information to him. Manafort was convicted on multiple counts of bank fraud and money laundering associated with his corrupt work in Ukraine. He lied to investigators looking into Trump’s Russia ties. He had connections to Trump’s so-called foreign policy adviser, Michael Flynn, whom Trump appointed as his first national security adviser, and who was ousted from that position after serving just two weeks for lying to the FBI about his connections to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\nTrump pardoned Flynn, too.\nHe pardoned George Papadopolous, another of his so-called foreign policy advisers, who met with Russian GRU agents in London offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Papadopolous was convicted of lying to the FBI about the Trump connections to Russia.\nTrump pardoned the execrable Roger Stone, who was Trump’s cut-out to the Russian intelligence computer hackers who stole Hillary Clinton’s and Democratic Party emails and published them just before the 2016 election to undercut the Clinton campaign. Stone was another Trump crony convicted of lying under oath and obstructing a congressional investigation into Trump’s collusion with Russians during his 2016 campaign.\nTrump pardoned Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer who was convicted of lying about his conversations with Manafort’s partner and Trump campaign official Rick Gates concerning Russia collusion.\nTrump also pardoned Steve Bannon, who along with Stone, had connections to the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys and One Percenters during the run-up to the Jan. 6 insurrection.\nAre we seeing a pattern here? You bet. Each of Trump’s pardons listed above was to benefit himself. During his time in the White House, Trump repeatedly waved the promise of pardons to keep his co-conspirators from cooperating with investigations he faced.  Shutting up Manafort alone helped him in his first impeachment for attempting to blackmail Ukrainian President Zelenskyy into opening a fake investigation in Ukraine of Joe Biden and his son Hunter. This created a savage backlash against Hunter Biden that was carried out for years by James Comer and his House Oversight Committee, which held countless hearings into what Comer called the “Biden crime family.”\nShutting up Michael Flynn got Trump out of his connections to Sergey Kislyak, who Trump invited to a meeting in the Oval Office, along with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the day after he had fired FBI Director James Comey because Comey had opened an investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russia connections.\nLet’s stop to consider what we’re talking about here. The first foreign official Trump invited into the Oval Office after becoming president was one Russian who had repeated meetings and phone calls with Trump campaign officials, and the Russian government official who, along with Vladimir Putin, controlled the Russian intelligence agents who were eventually indicted for hacking Democrats’ emails and interfering with the 2016 election.\nTrump ended up pardoning several people who in one way or another had connections to these two men. Lavrov would go on to have key involvement in Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, the country whose president Trump had tried to blackmail, and to which his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had multiple corrupt connections involving money, political influence, and Russian oligarchs close to Putin.\nThat is what Trump was doing with his pardon power.\nAnd now President Biden has pardoned his son Hunter, explaining in a letter that “raw politics” had influenced his son’s prosecution and led to a “miscarriage of justice.”\nThe raw politics of Washington D.C. as we head into another four years of rule by Donald Trump involves pre-planned miscarriage of justice. The Project 2025 plan that Trump claimed he had nothing to do with – before appointing four of its authors to his Cabinet – has an entire section devoted to exacting revenge on political opponents of Trump.\nIt is a cliché to say that the gloves are off, but that is the situation Donald Trump has purposefully created. He has threatened to investigate and prosecute anyone who was ever involved in investigating and prosecuting him. That would include Robert Mueller and his entire team of investigators and federal prosecutors. Of course, special counsel Jack Smith and his entire office, which includes FBI investigators and federal prosecutors, some of whom came out of retirement to work on the Trump investigation, are on Trump’s list for retribution. Kash Patel, Trump’s prospective FBI Director, has given several interviews about his plans to investigate anyone who has ever so much as picked up a pencil to bother his master.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nJoe Biden has his work cut out for him. He should empower an entire staff in the White House to begin working on blanket pardons for all the people mentioned above, plus members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who were involved in the two Trump impeachments and the House Jan. 6 committee.\nThe Biden pardon team should also take a serious look at the many reporters, columnists, and television news hosts who have stood up to Trump over the last eight years. That is another long list of people that Donald Trump has threatened to prosecute for simply doing their jobs as reporters, commentators, and cable news hosts.\nThat old aphorism “when they go low, we go high” was BS when it entered the political lexicon, and it’s a guarantee of a prison sentence at this point. There is no high road in the age of Donald Trump and his MAGA team of toadies and lackeys who are sworn to carry out the campaign of retribution Trump demands.\nThe Democratic Party isn’t just a political party anymore. It is an association of Americans who are under attack merely for their political beliefs. Loyalty to the Constitution and swearing to uphold its rights and guarantees of freedom has been turned into a crime by Donald Trump. People like Elon Musk and Leonard Leo are probably adding names to the list of enemies they would like to see behind bars for committing various “crimes” that aren’t crimes at all.\nNobody is safe. Trump has promised to build internment camps for undocumented immigrants he has declared war against. You won’t have to lack an American passport or work permit to be ushered into the walls of those camps once they’re built.\nTrump has gone to war against the America we have known. We don’t need to ask ourselves what this country has done to deserve the war Trump has planned against us. Biden needs to deploy his pardon power as a weapon in that war, and the Democratic Party needs to start recruiting not only followers but fighters. This is going to be an ugly four years, and it is way past time to prepare ourselves",

    "author": "Amanda Marcotte",
    "date": "December 3, 2",
    "text": "Even by the reality-TV chaos standards of our political moment, this one was a doozy: Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Defense, called out as an \"abuser of women\" by his own mother in the pages of the New York Times. To be fair, Penelope Hegseth's 2018 email excoriating her son, who was then a Fox News contributor, was not intended for public consumption. But the email, which seems to have been passed around Hegseth's social circle at the time, was leaked to the Times over the weekend. In it, Penelope Hegseth calls her son a man who \"belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego.\" Pete Hegseth, then 37 years old, was in the midst of his second divorce.\nWhile Penelope Hegseth has since disavowed her 2018 declaration, those accusations were backed up by a New Yorker investigation showcasing years of complaints from colleagues that Hegseth ran his veterans organization in \"a hostile and intimidating working environment,\" where sexual harassment — and even attempted sexual assault — was blown off or blamed on victims. Hegseth himself was characterized as a heavy drinker who \"treated the organization funds like they were a personal expense account — for partying, drinking, and using [the organization's] events as little more than opportunities to ‘hook up’ with women on the road.\" This follows reports that Hegseth was accused of rape in 2017. Criminal charges were not filed, but Hegseth reportedly reached a financial settlement with the alleged victim in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement.\nIn the years since, Hegseth — now on his third marriage — has claimed that he rediscovered Christ, saying \"faith became real\" to him in 2018. He became deeply involved with the Association of Classical Christian Schools (ACCS), moving to Tennessee to enroll his children in a branch of this fundamentalist organization. He also joined the associated denomination, the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches. Both are led by Doug Wilson, an untrained and self-proclaimed pastor who advocates for Christian nationalism and has become famous for his trollish promotion of his far-right political views. At the center of Wilson's philosophy is a misogyny so overt that it's sometimes hard to believe he's serious.\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.\n\"Wilson holds the most extreme views of women’s submission found in any form of Christianity,\" Julie Ingersoll, a professor of religious studies at the University of North Florida, told Salon. \"Women are taught that submission to their husbands (and other male authorities) is submission to God. Independence of any kind is cast as sin.\"\nIn one famous passage from his book on marriage, Wilson suggests that sexual violence is women's fault for not being submissive enough. \"[T]he sexual act cannot be made into an egalitarian pleasuring party,\" he writes. \"A man penetrates, conquers, colonizes, plants. A woman receives, surrenders, accepts.\" The alleged failure of women to submit, he continues, leads men to \"dream of being rapists,\" deprived of the \"erotic necessity\" found in women's submission. Nancy Wilson, Doug Wilson's wife, backs this view, comparing a wife to a \"garden\" cultivated for the husband's pleasure: \"But of course a husband is never trespassing in his own garden.\"\nWilson has repeatedly denied that such teachings are a justification for marital rape, but interviews with members of his church and students from his schools suggest they were left with little room for interpretation. Sarah Stankorb, who reported on sexual and domestic violence in the CREC for Vice and Slate, told Salon that female church members she interviewed \"understood that they must submit to their husbands in all things.\" In the church's marital counseling, \"submission is often treated as a cure-all\" and wives are instructed \"to fix marital problems by being sexually available.\"\nPodcaster Peter Bell and social media manager Sarah Bader have been producing a podcast about Wilson and the culture of abuse at CREC churches and ACCS schools, titled \"Sons of Patriarchy.\" They've recorded a seemingly endless number of interviews with people who witnessed or survived sexual abuse or domestic violence — and documenting the unwillingness of CREC leaders to take it seriously. Bader told Salon women are told they are \"accountable for all of their husband's sins\" and that Wilson just \"rewrapped rape as 'submission.'\" Students at ACCS schools who said they were sexually abused by teachers reported being blamed for causing the older men to \"stumble.\" Women say they've been blamed for being raped, for husbands who abuse alcohol and for men's infidelity.\nThe extremist view of gender \"inevitably contributes to a culture of abuse and draws abusers to it,\" Ingersoll said.\nWhile Wilson is focused on sex and discomforting descriptions of what he sees as women's sexual obligations to men, his demeaning attitudes about women expand beyond the bedroom. In a recent video titled \"The Natural Use of the Woman,\" Wilson argues that God designed women \"to make the sandwiches\" and chastised women who believe \"men have a responsibility\" to care about the marriage the same way wives do. During the election season, he argued that women's suffrage was a mistake and part of \"a long, sustained war on the family.\" He recommends that husbands who are dissatisfied with a wife's housework skills \"call the elders of the church and ask them for a pastoral visit.\" Stankorb explained that this implies excommunication, \"a serious threat for women who have no job or independent income.\"\nHegseth doesn't just attend a CREC church and send his kids to an ACCS school. He has associated publicly with Wilson's Christian nationalist teachings in multiple ways. Hegseth is a forceful advocate of the ACCS school system and championed Wilson's efforts to fight pandemic restrictions. After being nominated by Trump, Hegseth went on the \"CrossPolitic\" podcast, hosted by one of Wilson's pastors, and argued that ACCS schools allow Christian nationalists to \"build [their] army underground\" for an eventual takeover of American society. Hegseth has blamed sexual assault in the military on \"equality,\" claiming that the issue was \"exacerbated\" by letting women enlist in the first place. This aligns with CREC teachings that male sexuality is ravenous and the tendency to blame victims for \"immodesty\" when sexual violence happens. If Hegseth is confirmed to lead the Pentagon, Bell predicted he \"would not be worried about rape in military circles,\" because of these views.\nBell and Bader carefully monitor the larger CREC community and are alarmed by the response to Hegseth's nomination. \"They are celebrating his appointment,\" Bader explained, seeing it as \"this massive sign\" that \"they're on God's righteous plan.\" In their eyes, it's \"legitimizing everything Doug Wilson is saying and doing.\" That includes the over-the-top misogyny as well as Wilson's other radical views, such as his argument that American slavery \"was a relationship based upon mutual affection and confidence\" and that enslaved people enjoyed \"a life of plenty, of simple pleasures, of food, clothes, and good medical care.\" He has also said that the U.S. government should be based on his interpretation of Christianity, denying the plain language of the Constitution that calls for a secular order.\nIn joining a CREC church after two failed marriages, multiple adulteries, a rape accusation and allegations of sexual harassment, Hegseth is very much aligned with Trump's belief in doubling down rather than accepting criticism. Hegseth's mother ended her 2018 email by asking him to \"get some help and take an honest look at yourself.\" Instead, he joined a church whose culture is built around shielding men from accountability, while holding women responsible if they are victimized.",

    "author": "Andy Lee RothMickey Huff",
    "date": "December 3, 2",
    "text": "A 2024 Pew Research Center poll found that a remarkable 73 percent of adult Americans believe a free press is either extremely or very important to the well-being of society—though only a third of those polled believe that US media are completely free to report news. Indeed, half of those surveyed believe that US news organizations are influenced a great deal by corporate/financial interests (51%) or government/political interests (49%). Citing reports by the Associated Press and the Columbia Journalism Review, the Pew Research Center noted that “recent high-profile incidents such as a police raid on a Kansas newsroom and a government seizure of a Florida journalist’s materials have raised questions about press freedom in the U.S.”\nPew reported its findings in anticipation of World Press Freedom Day and before Reporters Without Borders (RSF) published the 2024 edition of its annual World Press Freedom Index. The United States ranked fifty-fifth among 180 nations for press freedoms in 2024, according to RSF, which defines press freedom as “the ability of journalists as individuals and collectives to select, produce, and disseminate news in the public interest independent of political, economic, legal, and social interference and in the absence of threats to their physical and mental safety.” RSF found press freedom is “problematic” in the United States, which earned a score of 66.59 out of a 100, a decline of nearly five points, compared to 2023 when the United States ranked forty-fifth in the world based on “satisfactory” levels of press freedom. Noting that the United States was “once considered a model for freedom of expression,” RSF reported that in 2024, “major structural barriers to press freedom persist,” including, for instance, highly concentrated media ownership that appears “to prioritize profits over public interest journalism,” declines in both local news and public trust in media, and the enactment of state and local laws that limit journalists’ access to public spaces.\nFrom a global perspective, RSF noted “a worrying decline” in respect for media autonomy, increased pressure from state or other political actors, and “a clear lack of political will on the part of the international community to enforce the principles of protection of journalists.” Nowhere has the latter been more evident than in Israeli-occupied Palestine, including Gaza especially, where RSF reported a “record number of violations against journalists and the media” since October 2023, including the killing of Palestinian journalists by Israel Defense Forces.\nThe US’s plunging press freedom is driven by a number of factors. Legislative attacks on media during the past year are one of the most ominous. In April 2024, Congress passed what is known as the TikTok “divestment-or-ban” bill, which President Biden quickly signed into law. In the Senate, the legislation passed as a rider on a measure to provide $95 billion in mostly military aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, the international news agency Reuters reported. The military aid warrants concern in its own right, but the added censorship of the popular social media platform is deeply problematic. As Omar Zahzah observed in a June 2024 article for Electronic Intifada, “It is no surprise that a bill furthering US funding for imperialism and genocide should also fortify US imperialism on the digital front.”\nSenator Ron Wyden, D-OR, warned that the legislation “provides broad authority that could be abused by a future administration to violate Americans’ First Amendment rights.” Senator Ed Markey, D-MA,  went further, warning, “We should be very clear about the likely outcome of this law. It’s really just a TikTok ban . . . Censorship is not who we are as a people. We should not downplay or deny this trade-off.”\nTikTok was ostensibly targeted because it is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. Even though other popular social media platforms also share user data for profit, violate users’ rights to privacy, contribute to the spread of misinformation and disinformation, and foster internet addiction, Congress and the White House singled out TikTok as the real threat. Their reasoning was that TikTok alone operated under Chinese influence and could share US users’ data with the Chinese government.\nNot long after Biden enacted the ban, which would force ByteDance to divest and allow a US company to assume control of the platform by early 2025, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) publicly admitted that the real reason TikTok had been targeted was its potential influence on the American public regarding Israel’s relentless bombardment of Palestinian civilians.\nAs protests spread across US colleges and universities in the spring of 2024, Romney questioned why Israel’s messaging on Gaza had been so “awful,” noting that “typically the Israelis are good at PR. What’s happened here?” Blinken quickly replied that those who opposed Biden’s support for Israel were being manipulated by social media, and TikTok in particular. Blinken went on to say that those pushing for a ceasefire were “on an intravenous feed of information with new impulses, inputs every millisecond,” and “the way this has played out on social media has dominated the narrative.” Ryan Grim of The Intercept called the exchange an “incredible historical document” that revealed how high-ranking US officials seek to control narratives and restrict information, especially around Israel and Gaza.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nCongressional zeal to throttle freedom of information did not stop at TikTok. Echoing the xenophobia that fueled anti-terrorism legislation after 9/11, in April 2024, the House of Representatives took aim at non-profits, passing—by a vote of 382–11—legislation that would authorize the secretary of the treasury to unilaterally remove the tax-exempt status of any 501(c)3 nonprofit determined to be a “terrorist supporting organization.”\nThe legislation prompted the Charity & Security Network, a resource and advocacy center for nonprofit organizations that work in conflict zones, to warn policymakers of “the parade of horribles that could cascade from this broad legislation that uses the targeting of charities as a vehicle for larger political motives.”\nAlthough numerous anti-terrorism laws already restrict nonprofits—like other organizations—from providing funding to foreign terrorist organizations, making the proposed legislation “redundant and unnecessary,” according to the Charity & Security Network, the Senate quickly introduced a companion measure, S. 4136, after the House voted its approval.\nSeth Stern, director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, explained that the legislation could provide new, more robust tools for government officials to target nonprofit news organizations. Noting that elected officials have already called for terrorism investigations of the New York Times, Reuters, CNN, and the Associated Press, Stern warned against “passing overbroad and unnecessary new laws” that provide government officials with “brand new ways to harass and silence journalists who don’t toe the line.”\nWith multiple ongoing crises and an increasingly unstable world, the United States needs journalists who refuse to toe the line more than ever. The fundamental missions of journalism are to hold the powerful to account and to give the public the information required to be citizens of a democracy. These increasingly bold attacks on the media threaten to undermine those missions and turn our press into megaphones for government and corporate elites eager to escape journalistic scrutiny and public accountability.",

    "text": "The Supreme Court is set to hear one of the most important trans rights cases in history on Wednesday, with the nation's highest court set to decide whether a state-level ban on gender-affirming care for minors is an unconstitutional form of sex discrimination.\nThe ban in question, passed by Tennessee's Republican-led legislature in the form of SB1, prevents doctors from prescribing puberty blockers, hormone treatment or surgery to minors experiencing gender dysphoria. The same medications can be prescribed to cisgender teens who go through puberty too early or too late, but not for those who feel uncomfortable with their assigned gender.\nUnited States v. Skrmetti was brought forward by three Tennessee transgender youth and their families, who argue that the ban is discriminatory and violates the Equal Protection Clause in the U.S. Constitution.\nIn defending its ban, the state of Tennessee has repeatedly cited the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, which overturned the federal right to abortion and gave jurisdiction over reproductive rights to the states. Tennessee also maintains that the ban does no discriminate on the basis of sex, arguing that it is instead a healthcare regulation that applies to all.\n“The law draws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. Boys and girls fall on both sides of that line,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, a Republican, wrote in a legal brief.\nThe case comes at a contentious time for trans rights. Anti-trans messaging was a backbone of President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign, boosted by right-wing groups like the Heritage Foundation and the Alliance Defending Freedom. According to a survey by the Associated Press, 55% of voters and 85% of Trump voters said support for trans rights in government has gone too far.\nLast year, Trump threatened to punish any physician who provided gender-affirming care to minors.\n“No serious country should be telling its children that they were born with the wrong gender,” Trump said in a video posted to his Truth Social account. “Under my leadership, this madness will end.”\nSince the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, at least 26 states have restricted or banned gender-affirming care for minors, despite the objections and guidelines brought forward by a number of U.S. medical associations.\n“We’ve seen just how far extreme politicians will push to deny us our reproductive freedom, from banning abortion to threatening IVF to even threatening to put doctors in jail for providing emergency care, with deadly consequences for women’s lives,” Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement.\n“The same politicians who are trying to control women have now set their sights on transgender people and their families and are trying to control their bodies and lives,\" Dalven said. \"Allowing politicians to continue down this road could hold severe implications for the freedom of all people to decide what is right for their own body.\"",

    "text": "On election eve, Arlene Battishill, a retired history professor and political analyst known as \"Dr. Arlene Unfiltered\" to her social media followers, picked up a bottle of champagne, confident in the data across different states that showed a potential Kamala Harris win.\nBut a different narrative had emerged on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform founded in 2020, built on blockchain technology and banned in the U.S. It had consistently shown Trump leading since his September debate with Harris, and it ultimately proved more accurate than conventional polling methods that showed the race in a dead heat.\n\"This is the third consecutive presidential election in which [Donald] Trump was underestimated by polls,\" said Harry Crane, a professor of statistics at Rutgers University. \"The betting markets were spot on in this cycle, despite attacks from the mainstream media and pollsters, both of which were wrong in their analysis.\"\nThe results, supporters say, bolster the case for prediction markets as they become more mainstream and seek to expand election betting in the U.S.\nPolymarket's 26-year-old CEO, Shayne Coplan, celebrated on CNBC's Squawk Box after the election, calling it an “inflection point in news and politics.\" Polymarket \"was a good two, three hours ahead of the media,” Coplan said. “If you were just watching TV, you’d think it’s neck and neck.”\nBut \"Dr. Arlene,\" in a Q&A session with her followers, predicted that \"a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money\" on the platforms.\n\"People are going to get slaughtered financially. It's the most irresponsible thing to be betting on our democracy,\" she said.\nLaunched in 2020, Polymarket secured a $70 million funding round in May 2024 led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. Major media outlets like CNBC and The Economist now regularly cite its predictions. Bettors put billions of dollars on the presidential race before Election Day.\nCoplan told CNBC he received election-night calls from Mar-a-Lago, where the Trump campaign was tracking his victory on Polymarket. “It was surreal,” Coplan said.\nDays later, the FBI raided Coplan's New York City home and seized his electronics — part of an investigation into Polymarket allegedly accepting trades from U.S.-based users, Bloomberg reported. Coplan suggested the raid was politically motivated, posting on X: \"It's discouraging that the current administration would seek a last-ditch effort to go after companies they deem to be associated with political opponents.\"\nAt competitor Kalshi, Americans legally bet $100 million on the presidential race after the platform successfully challenged the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's ban on election betting in October, NPR reported. The decision by Biden-appointed Judge Jia Cobb marked a return to a practice that was commonplace in American races until the turn of the 20th century. The CFTC has appealed the ruling.\nKalshi, which attracted about $1 billion in overall bets on the election, headed back to court in November to counter the appeal, saying that only Congress has the authority to ban election betting.\nCritics remain unconvinced. \"It's pure gambling. Election betting can forecast the future no better than gambling whether or not you'll get 21 in blackjack,\" said Cantrell Dumas, director of derivatives policy at Better Markets.\n\"It's just preposterous to think that gamblers are able to call the election,\" Dumas said.\nTraditional polling's credibility took another hit in the 2024 presidential race. Ann Selzer called it quits after her Iowa poll predicting a Harris win missed by double digits. A Rutgers-Eagleton poll showed a huge lead for Harris that turned out to be much narrower.\nA common argument for prediction market advocates is that betting on election outcomes is more \"pure\" and in line with market forces than traditional polling, which they say can be politically biased and manipulated.\n\"Betting markets incentivize being right and disincentivize being wrong. If you're right you make money, if you're wrong you lose money,\" said Crane, the Rutgers professor. \"You can't say the same about polling. Pollsters continue to put out polls cycle after cycle even when they are badly wrong.\"\nWhile nobody knows the long-term future of prediction markets in the U.S., the Trump administration's return to power could reshape it for betting enthusiasts, he said.\n\"If the new administration follows through on its promise of promoting liberty and eliminating needless bureaucracy and regulation, then the betting markets will flourish in the coming years,\" Crane said. \"I expect that election betting markets will continue to grow in popularity and will be much larger and more widely accepted next time around.\"",

    "date": "November 21, 2",
    "text": "Ariana Grande ought to be celebrating.\nThe actor and singer is receiving rave reviews for her comedic turn in John M. Chu's big-screen adaptation of the hit Broadway musical \"Wicked.\" With her onscreen partner in crime Cynthia Erivo, the two have traversed the globe to promote their movie, which serves as a prequel to \"The Wizard of Oz\" and follows the evolution of Glinda (Grande) and Elphaba (Erivo) from frenemies to best friends at Shiz University in the magical world of Oz.\nUltimately, \"Wicked\" is the tale of friendship overcoming how Elphaba has been ostracized for her unusual appearance: her bright green skin. However, this message about superficial prejudice has not fully penetrated to people online who continue to pick apart Grande's appearance.\nOver the last several weeks as the stars have promoted their film, viral posts across several different social media platforms have been pointing out Grande's slender frame while also sharing their opinions about the artist's mental health. It's a disturbing pattern Grande herself had to address last year. But despite her plea for people to refrain from commenting on her body and anyone's body, that hasn't stopped the unfounded diagnoses.\nSalon goes over the timeline of the focus placed on Grande's body and mental health over the years:\nJune 2018: Grande discusses mental health issues after 2017 Manchester concert bombing\nAt her 2017 sold-out Manchester, England concert, Grande was present during a terrorist attack that claimed 22 lives and injured more than 500 people.\nIn an interview with Elle, the star opened up about the residual trauma from the deadly attack.\n“When I got home from tour, I had really wild dizzy spells, this feeling like I couldn’t breathe,” she said. “I would be in a good mood, fine and happy, and they would hit me out of nowhere. I’ve always had anxiety, but it had never been physical before. There were a couple of months straight where I felt so upside down.”\nApril 2019: The singer posted a scan of her brain, opening up about her PTSD\nAfter the Manchester attack and the sudden overdose of her off-and-on boyfriend and rapper Mac Miller, Grande shared a photo of her brain scan.\nIn a follow-up post, Grande said she was doing her best even though her brain “looks like the world map.” She continued, “Didn’t mean to startle anyone with my brain thingy.\n“I love science and seeing the physical reality of what’s going on in there was incredible to me. Someday, when I’m more healed up, we can talk more about it. I am constantly working on my health/learning how to process pain (aren't we all),\" she said.\nApril 2023: Grande posts a TikTok addressing people's comments about her body\nBody-shaming comments seem to have hit a nerve with Grande last year. The star was still filming \"Wicked\" in the Spring of 2023 when her Instagram was flooded with comments and concerns about her thinness and what people perceived as a visible weight loss.\nThe singer then took to TikTok to address the rampant speculation and \"concern\" around her weight. On the video was a caption that stated, \"You have talked a lot about it over the past decade or longer so I'd like to join in this time.\n\"I think we should gentler and less comfortable commenting on people's bodies — no matter what. If you think good or well-intentioned — whatever it is — healthy, unhealthy, big, small, this or that. We just shouldn't. We should work towards not doing that as much,\" she emphasized.\nShe suggested that people should aim towards tweaking their compliments or ignoring something that bothers them so they don't comment at all to \"keep each other safer.\"\nGrande added, \"There are many different ways to look healthy and beautiful. I know personally for me, the body you've been comparing my current body to was the unhealthiest version of my body.\"\nThe singer revealed that in the past, \"I was on a lot of antidepressants and drinking on them and eating poorly and at the lowest point of my life when I looked the way you consider my healthy. But that in fact wasn't my healthy.\"\nShe also reiterated she didn't have to explain this but wanted to have an openness and vulnerability with her audience to enact some positive change.\n\"You never know what someone's going through. Even if you are coming from a loving place and a caring place, that person probably is working on it or has a support system that they are working on it with,\" Grande said. \"So, be gentle with each other and with yourselves.\"\nOctober - November 2024: Numerous popular posts claim Erivo and Grande have eating disorders\nWhile Grande has already addressed the concerns around her weight the hypervisiblity of the \"Wicked\" press tour has revived the discourse. But this time it included Erivo too.\nIn viral posts across platforms like Reddit, X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, people are speculating about why both Erivo and Grande look thinner. As their proof, they are posting photos of the actors years before they filmed \"Wicked\" comparing them to photos after filming the movie, while they're promoting the movie\nOthers on TikTok are claiming that they have insight into the actors' weight loss and bodies. One post said, \"Anyone who's been in a mutually destructive competitive ED friendship knows exactly what's going on.\"\nInfluencer Chloe Forero said, \"You could not pay me to say that Ariana Grande looks healthy because she does not. She looks sick . . . I want to approach this with sympathy because I understand that Ariana Grande is in the limelight and that comes with so much pressure. We have no choice but to acknowledge she is a role model and she does set an example for a lot of people. Little girls might see the billboard on the highway of Ariana looking strikingly thin and think they should look like that.”\nIn a USA Today interview, an eating disorder expert, Dr. Elizabeth Wassenaar at the Eating Recovery Center explained, \"These comments about how your body is acceptable or unacceptable, it reinforces again that you are not worth more than your body and that you have to present yourself a certain way for the world to find you acceptable.\"\nShe continued, \"It just reinforces that sort of superficial, body-focused idea that we know is so painful and harmful for every single one of us because we are so much more than this vessel that carries us.\"\nNov. 6: On \"Las Culturistas,\" Grande calls out people who try to diagnose her\nOn the podcast \"Las Culturistas,\" Grande, along with her \"Wicked\" co-star Bowen Yang and podcast co-host Matt Rogers were joking about the internet's intrusive ability to diagnose a celebrity with a mental illness without the full picture.\nRogers said, \"I have a mental illness that no one can tell me what it is!\"\nGrande chimed in, \"Well, Twitter will tell you!\"\nRogers replied, \"One day they all came for me like 'Matt has ADHD' and I was like 'Pfft stop!' Now I'm like, 'I do!'\"\nGrande then shared, “They tell me I have a lot of things . . . You're actually invasive and scary, and triggering. Just wrong and loud, and unhealthy — that's toxic.”",

    "text": "With some of President-elect Donald Trump’s allies promising to dismantle entire federal departments and the incoming administration laying the groundwork for mass layoffs, experts say Trump is likely to start with targeted firings aimed at making an example of specific civil servants as he tests the waters in his second administration.\nWhile the incoming Trump administration is laying the groundwork to change the rules to be able to fire civil servants en masse, Don Kettl, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, told Salon that he expects them to try making an example of a few key targets first.\n“Henry VIII didn't need to kill them all, he just needed to kill a few,” Kettl said. “He just needed some heads on spikes to make an example.”\nThe Heritage Foundation has, for example, circulated a list of targets at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services that they believe are “in league with left-wing open border groups” and that would like to see removed from the civil service. Kettl said Trump’s allies probably have similar lists for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department and other agencies the president and his allies feel were insufficiently loyal in his first term.\n“Only a fool would try to dismiss large numbers of federal employees,” Kettl said. “It’s one thing to throw sand in the gears of the federal government, it’s another to try to destroy it.”\nHowever, the first steps towards either mass dismissals or targeted example-making will be the same — reviving a policy first instituted in Oct. 2020 by an executive order creating an employment category known as “Schedule F.”\nIn the federal government, civil servants are divided into different employment categories. In 2020, Trump created Schedule F as a new classification for those whose role is “of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.”\nFor those seeking to dismantle the administrative state or particular departments, the important part is that Schedule F civil servants would not enjoy the same employment protections afforded most civil servants and would instead be at-will employees, who could be easily dismissed.\nMany estimates have floated a figure of around 50,000 federal employees whose positions could be reclassified to Schedule F. However, the National Treasury Employee Union has warned that, according to its review of Trump-era documents from the Office of Management and Budget, the number of potential Schedule F civil servants could be much higher.\nCritics have panned the plan as a return to the spoils system, in which a political figure would reward loyalists with government appointments, and a break from merit-based civil service, which has existed in one form or another since the Pendleton Act’s passage in 1883. Since the act's passage, it has been illegal to fire merit-selected civil servants for political reasons. Schedule F would serve as a way around these protections.\nPresident Joe Biden introduced federal regulations earlier this year aimed at blocking Trump from reinstituting Schedule F through the Office of Personnel Management. Kettl said, however, that because these regulations were done through the executive branch and not legislation, Trump will probably be able to undo them very quickly.\n“Anything that is put in regulation can be removed by regulation,” Kettl told Salon. “If they wanted they could institute an interim final rule at 12:30 pm on January 20th.”\nOnce in power, Kettl explained, the question for the Trump administration will be “what kind of signals do they want to send and legally what kind of process do they want to go through?”\nRonald Sanders, a senior fellow at George Washington University’s Center for Excellence in Public Leadership, who has worked on nine presidential transitions and held positions across the federal government, told Salon that between Schedule F and the power the president maintains over the rest of the federal workforce, the incoming administration has laid the groundwork to dismiss people first and resolve outstanding issues later.\n“In a word, it's pretty complicated but if the Trump administration wanted to run roughshod over that and basically say ‘you’re fired,’ they could and let the Merit Systems Protection Board and the courts sort it all out and it's my suspicion that that is what will happen,” Sanders said.\nAccording to Sanders, however, there are reasons why the Trump administration might choose not to pursue mass layoffs out of the gate first. The first reason is that even Republicans do not want “large numbers of laid-off civil servants in their districts.”\nThe second is that the combination of the threat of Schedule F, promises to move government jobs out of Washington D.C., and the introduction of political considerations into what were once merit-based roles may be enough to engender mass resignations.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees has warned about, with the union’s policy director, Jacqueline Simon, telling the Hill that they’re expecting an “exodus.”\n“They do not want to be political appointees. They don’t want politics to interfere with any aspect of their job,” Simon said.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nSanders noted that such an exodus could be just as destructive to administrative agencies while not being subject to the same legal scrutiny as mass firings. Sanders said that, often, the people who leave the civil service voluntarily in such a scenario are those who can find the most attractive job offers elsewhere or may be near retirement, meaning an exodus would erode institutional memory in these departments.\nSeveral legal grey areas will likely need to be resolved in court and could complicate a scheme to reclassify tens of thousands of civil servants as Schedule F or to fire them. Encouraging voluntary resignations wouldn’t have the same hang-ups.\nIn Sanders’ opinion, the biggest legal issue is whether veterans would retain their right to appeal a dismissal even if their position was reclassified as Schedule F. Given that veterans account for 30% of the federal workforce, this represents a significant complication.\nSanders, who resigned from his position as chair of the Federal Salary Council over Schedule F during the first Trump administration, noted that he is an “unashamed Republican” but that he worries about “an ulterior motive” behind the staffing changes.\nWhile proponents of Schedule F say the policy is meant to ensure the federal government is responsive to elections, Sanders said he’s concerned the changes are intended to ensure loyalty and to “prevent those agencies from doing their jobs” via understaffing.\nSanders also said that, regardless of intent, introducing this level of political consideration into civil service positions stands to compromise the advice that civil servants give to the administration.\n“Civil servants are empowered to give frank and fearless advice to their political masters,” Sanders said. “You don't want them to tell a political appointee what they think that political appointee wants to hear — you want them to tell the truth.”",

    "title": "Why Democrats seem so disconnected from what voters want",
    "author": "Chauncey DeVega",
    "date": "December 2, 2",
    "text": "Nearly one month later, the Democratic Party and the pundits and other politics experts are continuing to study the wreckage of the 2024 election. They are asking themselves how this could have possibly happened. How could we have been so wrong in assessing the country’s mood? They need to quickly come up with the correct answer because they are running out of time. Trump has promised a campaign of revenge and retribution against his perceived enemies. He is not kidding.\nThe public opinion polls suggested that the election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump would be very close — and more specifically that Harris would be much more competitive, if not the victor. Of course, this did not happen. The fabled Democratic blue wall was easily smashed by Trump and his MAGA movement. Trump also made in-roads as he won support from key parts of the Democratic Party’s base across the country. This hinted at a larger trend as Kamala Harris and the Democrats experienced a collapse of support among a wide range of voters. The result: Trump would increase his support by more than two million votes as compared to the 2020 election. By comparison, Harris received seven million fewer votes than President Biden did in 2020.\nIn a recent essay at The Conversation, historian and media critic W. Joseph Campbell offers this assessment:\nCampbell continues:\nAt the Columbia Journalism Review, Meghnad Bose makes this intervention about how the news media chooses to present the polls in the context of other information:\nHere is one of the main challenges of public opinion polls, even high-quality ones and how the news media uses them: public opinion polls represent a snapshot in time that gains more meaning in hindsight after we see how and if they were correct and accurate or not relative to the final results of a given election. Polls usually do not explain how and why a given person (or cohort) feels about a given issue and their reasoning for that conclusion.\nIn a global moment of discontent with democracy and the order of things, the \"why?” of emotions and political decision-making among the mass public are of paramount importance. Populism, in its most raw form, is collective action based on shared emotions, meaning, reality and feelings of community and collective experience(s) in service to a leader(s) and “the cause.” To ignore this aspect of politics is to overlook one of the main drivers of Trump’s enduring power and appeal, specifically, and that of the MAGA movement and American fascism, more generally.\nIn total, what the mainstream news media and political class need is a better understanding of what social theorists describe as “life worlds,” the subjective reality that a given individual(s) uses to make sense of the world and which develops relative to material circumstances and relationships. As a whole, the mainstream news media, the political class and other elites generally assume that their understanding of reality and “the facts” — and of course what constitutes “rational behavior” — are universal. They are not.\nIn a recent article, Salon staff reporter Russell Payne offers this important example of the dynamic dogging Democrats:\nSuch hubris and arrogance are one of the main reasons why the mainstream news media (especially the centrists and the liberals and progressives who have a platform in the legacy news media) and the Democrats and their consultants were caught so off guard by Trump’s win in 2024 (and also in 2016).\nTo that point, focus groups revealed a much different story, one that I would suggest was a better predictor of Trump’s win than a “conventional wisdom” born of obsessive readings and interpretations of the public opinion polls. For example, in a Nov. 3 column at The New York Times ominously (and presciently) titled “Our 61 Focus Groups Make Me Think Trump Has a Good Chance of Winning\", Patrick Healey writes:\nThe Times continues:\nIn September, The New York Times shared the results of another focus group that also signaled great trouble ahead for Kamala Harris and the Democrats:\nIn this much-discussed example, one voter told The Philadelphia Inquirer that he knows that Donald Trump is like “Hitler”, but he supported him anyway. This is only one man's explanation, but it is still very insightful and illustrative of the broader trends that led to Trump's victory and Harris' defeat.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nOf course, this is not the ideal model of civic virtue, reasoning, “rational behavior” or placing that thing known as “democracy” — however vaguely defined and (mis)understood by the public — above all other concerns that the Democrats, mainstream news media and responsible political class assumed would be a winning and self-evident message to the American voting public. Moreover, and perhaps even more troubling for what it portends about the enduring power of American fascism and authoritarianism, is how this Pennsylvania voter's reasoning for why he supported Trump is a damning indictment of the country’s larger culture. For many Americans, “Hitler” and “fascism” are just words and images that have no factual or reality-based historical grounding or meaning. This is a function of a culture of distraction and amusement and how so many Americans live in a type of survival mode where larger concerns about society and the future are overridden by the individual and the immediate. The legitimacy crisis facing America’s (and the world’s) democratic and other governing institutions is very real and will not be dissipating any time soon.\nAs social theorist Henry Giroux writes in a recent essay at CounterPunch:\nSuch an environment is toxic for a healthy democracy. Desperate people yearn for strongmen and other such autocrats and dictators who promise easy solutions to complex problems. If one wants a parsimonious or unifying explanation for Trump and the MAGA movement’s “surprise” victory in the 2024 election it is that.\nUltimately, the Democrats, the mainstream news media and other defenders of \"the institutions\" will find few truly meaningful answers in polling or focus groups or some other tool or measure in isolation.\nInstead, they need to look at the larger picture of the social forces and emotions and meaning – and crisis – that explains how we “the Americans” got here and hopefully how we can escape the Age of Trump.",

    "text": "It's not a coincidence that Donald Trump's nominee for Education Secretary, Linda McMahon, is the defendant in a lawsuit alleging that she ignored widespread sexual abuse of minors at World Wrestling Entertainment when she was CEO. Abandoning children to predatory forces who wish to dominate and exploit them seems to be a requisite of the job under the incoming Trump administration. In his first term, Trump picked Amway heiress Betsy DeVos to run the Education Department because of her long history of anti-public school activism. This time, he simply needs someone who will stand aside as an army of far-right Christians, emboldened by the rise of groups like Moms for Liberty, take the lead in attacking the very foundations of free, secular education.\nChristian nationalists aren't even waiting for Trump to be sworn in for a second time before they make their move. Pete Hegseth, the Fox News host who Trump tapped to be Defense Secretary, was on a Christian nationalist podcast last week that described the vision. \"I think we need to be thinking in terms of these classical Christian schools are boot camps for winning back America,\" explained the host, who is closely linked with Douglas Wilson, a far-right pastor who advocates for theocracy. Hegseth, who is facing scrutiny after it was revealed he settled out of court with a woman who accused him of rape in 2017, concurred. He called for an \"educational insurgency\" where \"you build your army underground\" of children, so they can grow up to be the next generation of fundamentalist culture warriors.\nOklahoma's state superintendent, Ryan Walters, wasted no time in harnessing the taxpayer-funded school system to push the Christian nationalist agenda. Mere days after Trump's election, Walters announced a new public department with an Orwellian name: \"Office of Religious Liberty and Patriotism.\" Unsurprisingly, the goal is to attack religious liberty, by forcing his brand of Christianity on students. Walters then mandated all schools show kids a video where he lambasted the \"radical left\" and the \"woke teachers unions.\" He also attempted to lead a prayer, saying, \"I pray in particular for Donald Trump.\" Trump probably cares less about the prayers and more that Walters lines his pockets. The superintendent has used the public education budget to purchase Trump-branded Bibles for Oklahoma classrooms.\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.\nSo far, this flagrant violation of the Constitution hasn't worked. The state attorney general stepped in and declared that Walters cannot mandate the viewing of his propaganda. Some school districts refused, though it's quite possible others gave in out of an unwillingness to fight with Walters to defend their students. More importantly, this is just an escalation of an all-out effort by Walters to turn Oklahoma's public schools into exactly the \"boot camps\" building up the \"army\" of Christian nationalists that Hegseth and his cronies imagine.\nWalters is the biggest showboat, but there are already signs that Christian nationalists are ramping up this \"educational insurgency\" across the country. Last week, the Texas state school board voted to replace traditional reading materials for elementary kids with Bible study. This is not hyperbole. The Dallas Morning News ran excerpts from the curriculum, which includes lessons on the Sermon on the Mount, the \"prodigal son\" Bible story, and explicitly teaches that \"Jesus rose from the dead,\" treating the myth of the resurrection as historical fact. Lest there be any doubt this is about anything but using schools to proselytize, the school board meeting was crushed with evangelicals praying for this opportunity to push their faith on the captive audience of school children.\nThe school board justified this decision by making the curriculum \"optional,\" but that's misleading. For one thing, it's only \"optional\" for school districts. If those are the books a district chooses, then that's what students and teachers must live with. Worse, the state is bribing districts who pick it up by paying them $40 a student if they adopt the curriculum. For poorer, often rural districts, that money can be hard to pass up. \"The board’s vote represents a troubling attempt to turn public schools into Sunday schools,\" Carisa Lopez, Texas Freedom Network Deputy Director, said in a statement. And even though the GOP talks a big game about \"parents' rights,\" she pointed out this undermines \"the freedom of families to direct the religious education of their own children.\"\nIn Arizona, the Christian nationalist war on education has grown so aggressive that it's threatening to tank the state's budget. As Politico reported Sunday, a government program that was originally \"created for students with disabilities who needed services they could not get at their neighborhood public schools\" has become \"a budget-busting free-for-all used by more than 50,000 students.\" That's because anti-public education Christian organizers have been encouraging people to abuse the program to lavishly fund religious schools or even homeschooling. \"Families, mostly from high-income zip codes, have applied the taxpayer funds for everything from ski lift passes to visits to trampoline parks, a $4,000 grand piano, more than a million dollars in Legos, online ballet lessons, horse therapy and cookie-baking kits.\"\nThe goal appears to be to suck so much money out of public school systems that they collapse. As Kathryn Joyce revealed in an investigative report at Salon, the masterminds behind this scheme envision religious schools and Christian homeschooling as a replacement — which implies, though they will rarely admit it, no school at all for people who don't want or can't afford those options. It's a different strategy than those in Oklahoma and Texas pushing Bible study directly into public classrooms. They're all working towards the same goal, however: Making sure that most, if not all American students are taught that the only \"real\" Americans are fundamentalist Christians.\nIt's also an assault on one of the most crucial aspects of a real education: critical thinking skills.\nAuthoritarians are notoriously hostile to teaching kids intellectual autonomy, preferring children to exhibit mindless obedience. Southern Methodist University religious studies professor Mark Chancey, who has been speaking out against the Texas curriculum, worries that \"when the lesson has a teacher read that Jesus was resurrected from the dead,\" students \"are going to hear their teacher promoting that as a factual claim.\" That is, of course, very much the point. Trump's election showed that the MAGA right's power depends largely on supporters who can't separate fact from fiction, mythology from science, or conspiracy theory from truth. That's why Hegseth wants to reimagine schools as \"boot camps\": not places where children learn to think for themselves, but where they are unquestioning right-wing soldiers, following MAGA orders.",

    "author": "Charles R. Davis",
    "date": "November 26, 20",
    "text": "Donald Trump, who won in part due to inflation that peaked two years ago, campaigned on a policy of making everything from vegetables to televisions more expensive, suggesting a plurality of voters either did not understand tariffs — and the rippling economic impact of raising taxes on imported goods — or simply did not believe the Republican candidate would follow through.\nIn a Monday evening post on Truth Social, the president-elect reaffirmed that yeah, he’s serious.\n“On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,” the 78-year-old wrote, falsely implying the taxes will be paid by exporting countries and not American consumers. In a separate post, he added that “we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all their many products coming into the United States of America.”\nOstensibly, these taxes are part of the war on drugs and the war on migrants: Trump blames China and America’s closest neighbors for allowing fentanyl and asylum-seekers to come across the border, claiming his tariffs will end only when “Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this invasion of our Country!”\nIf Trump’s boast is true, American consumers will immediately see an impact — if not at the border, at least at Best Buy and their local grocer.\n“Enjoy your cheap avocados and electronics while you can,” commented Masha Krupenkin, a political scientist at Boston College.\n“Donald Trump’s first act as president will be to intentionally *raise* prices for the American people,” added Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va.\nThat’s not speculation or simple partisanship in action. Even if Trump purports not to grasp how tariffs work — ask yourself: if he was charged a tax, would he pass the cost along to consumers or accept lower profits for himself, personally? — the question of import levies and their impact has certainly been considered by those they would impact.\nA study recently commissioned by the National Retail Federation, a trade group, found that Trump unilaterally imposing new taxes on imported goods would dramatically inflate costs and potentially devastate the economy. Indeed, Walmart is already saying it'll have to raise prices.\n“Consumers would pay $13.9 billion to $24 billion more for apparel; $8.8 billion to $14.2 billion more for toys; $8.5 billion to $13.1 billion more for furniture; $6.4 billion to $10.9 billion more for household appliances; $6.4 billion to $10.7 billion more for footwear, and $2.2 billion to $3.9 billion more for travel goods,” the study found. Overall, Americans could see their spending power diminished by $46 billion to $78 billion.\nIn March, the Center for American Progress Action Fund also released an analysis that found Trump’s tariffs would amount to a $1,500 tax increase for the average U.S. household — and that was assuming a 10% tariff, less than half of what the president-elect has now proposed on goods from America’s leading trade partners.\nNeither study accounts for the potentially cascading effects of tariffs. Housing will become even more expensive as the costs of imported materials skyrocket, for example. Consumers may have no choice but to pay higher prices for necessities, but they may also decide to buy less overall; manufacturers who rely on cheap parts from China may find their customers are unwilling to pay twice the price. In such a scenario, the U.S. is not only facing inflation but a contracting national economy and rising unemployment.\nAs the nonpartisan Tax Foundation notes, Trump’s proposed tariffs have been subjected to no fewer than a dozen macroeconomic analyses, all of which “consistently find” that they “would have a negative impact on the United States economy. They would also invite corruption, the foundation observed: an analysis of tariffs during Trump’s first term found that companies “that made political donations to Republican candidates were more likely to be granted tariff exemptions than firms that gave to Democrats.”\nIt’s hard to say Trump will abandon tariffs due to their obvious and negative economic cost when they enable him, personally, to pick winners and losers in the U.S. economy. But the president-elect is also a self-styled master negotiator who perhaps does not want to actually tank the stock market but instead use the threat of tariffs to exact pledges he can claim as victories.\nDean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic Research, speculates that Trump, “or at least someone with his ear,” presumably knows that Americans are not clamoring for higher prices. “That means that Trump does not actually want his import taxes on goods from Canada and Mexico to take effect,” he wrote on Bluesky. “Instead, he is looking to make a deal (you know Trump, the expert dealmaker), where [Canada's] Trudeau and [Mexico's] Sheinbaum pledge to crack down on fentanyl and migrants, kind of like they are already doing.”\nBut if Trump imposes tariffs on day one, that leaves exactly no time to negotiate before Americans begin seeing prices rise. Before diplomacy, there could well be a trade war, as Canada, Mexico and China impose their own taxes in retaliation and thus reduce the demand for U.S. exports.\nEswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, told The New York Times that we should not assume Trump is bluffing. Tariffs, like mass deportations, were a central selling point of his campaign, however economically destructive, and he has shown no sign of pivoting thus far.\n“The increasing specificity of Trump’s tariff threats,” he said, “both in terms of the amounts and the countries to be targeted, indicates the strong possibility that these are looming actions rather than just blustery threats.”",

    "title": "Republicans don't care if women die from abortion bans — but they don't want you to know about it",
    "author": "Amanda Marcotte",
    "date": "December 2, 2",
    "text": "After the Supreme Court ended federal abortion rights in 2022, there was a robust debate between pro- and anti-choice activists over whether or not banning abortion would kill women. Pro-choicers pointed to evidence, from both history and other countries, showing that abortion bans kill women. Anti-choice activists dismissed the record and pointed to toothless \"exceptions\" in abortion ban laws as \"proof\" that women could get abortions to save their lives.\nThe latter argument was frustrating not just because it was wrong but was generally offered in bad faith. Anti-abortion leaders know that abortion bans kill women. They don't care. Or worse, many view dying from pregnancy as a good thing. In some cases, it's viewed as just punishment for \"sinful\" behavior. Other times, it's romanticized as a noble sacrifice on the altar of maternal duty. But conservatives are aware that this death fetish cuts against their \"pro-life\" brand. So there was a lot of empty denials and hand-waving about the inevitable — and expected — outcome of women dying.\nWe now have another proof point that abortion bans are about misogyny, not \"life,\" as the first deaths from red state abortion bans are being reported. Instead of admitting they were wrong and changing course, Republicans are behaving like guilty liars do everywhere, and destroying the evidence. In the process, they are also erasing data needed to save the lives of pregnant women across the board, whether they give birth or not.\nProPublica has published a series of articles detailing the deaths of women in Georgia and Texas under the two states' draconian abortion bans. They most recently reported the death of Porsha Ngumezi, a 35-year-old mother of two from Texas. Ngumezi suffered a miscarriage at 11 weeks but was left to bleed to death at the hospital, instead of having the failing pregnancy surgically removed. Multiple doctors in Texas confirmed that hospital staff are often afraid to perform this surgery, however, because it's the same one used in elective abortions. Rather than risk criminal charges, doctors frequently stand by and let women suffer — or die.\nNgumezi's youngest son doesn't fully understand that his mother is dead. ProPublica reported that he chases down women he sees in public who have similar hairstyles, calling for his mother.\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.\nA day after this story was published, the Washington Post reported that the Texas maternal mortality board would skip reviewing the deaths of pregnant women in 2022 and 2023 — conveniently, the first two years after the abortion ban went into place. The leadership claims it's about speeding up the review process, but of course, many members pointed out the main effect is that \"they would not be reviewing deaths that may have resulted from delays in care caused by Texas’s abortion bans.\"\nThis is especially noteworthy because it's become standard after one of these reports for anti-abortion activists to blame the victims and/or the doctors, and not the bans. Christian right activist Ingrid Skop, for instance, responded to Nguzemi's death by insisting \"physicians can intervene to save women’s lives in pregnancy emergencies\" under the Texas law. If she really believed that, however, she would desperately want the state maternal mortality board to review this, and other cases like it, so they could come up with recommendations for hospital staff to treat women without running afoul of the law. Strop, however, is on the Texas maternal mortality board. She was likely part of the decision to refuse to look into whether women like Nguzemi might be saved.\nSo the likeliest explanation is the simple, if brutal one: Anti-abortion activists do not want doctors to save women's lives. The current situation, where doctors are afraid to treat women and have no guidance on how to do so safely, is a status quo they are fighting to preserve. We also know this because, as Jessica Valenti reported at Abortion Every Day last week, these same activists are lobbying to rewrite current abortion bans to remove the paltry \"exceptions\" that do exist. Instead of allowing doctors to abort pregnancies that are failing, they want to force them to induce labor instead. That is not just cruel but will kill women. We know this because that's exactly how Nguzemi died; her doctor gave her a drug in hopes it would push the pregnancy out, rather than surgically remove it, as is the standard of care.\nThe Texas decision comes on the heels of a similar move in Georgia, which dismissed the maternal mortality board members to punish them for giving journalists the facts about the deaths of two other women killed by that state's abortion ban. Georgia's only slightly better than Texas, in that they aren't even bothering to pretend this isn't a cover-up. The head of the health department explicitly cited the sharing of information \"with outside individuals\" as the reason for the board being disbanded.\nThis censorship effort doesn't just impact the data about abortion ban-related deaths, either. Before 2022, both Texas and Georgia had some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country. There's been an eye-popping 56% rise in pregnancy-related deaths in Texas over the past few years. Anyone who actually cared about women or \"life\" would want to get to the bottom of that. But people like Skop already know what the likely answer will be: Many of these women are dying because they can't get timely abortion care. Some are dying from unsafe abortions. Some are being murdered by partners who are trying to trap them with pregnancy. There's evidence that the overall quality of ob-gyn care in abortion ban states has declined, as doctors flee to legally safer environments. Some will have died, like Nguzemi, after being denied standard miscarriage management care.\nBut despite claims to be \"pro-life,\" anti-abortion activists do not care. Instead, they are on Twitter griping about how comprehensive reproductive health care access \"promotes sexual promiscuity.\"\nNo, seriously, this is their priority while women are dying.\nSkop also argued last year that abortion bans are justified because \"promiscuous behavior declines.\" It's tempting to point out that all five women whose deaths have been reported by ProPublica were in long-term relationships or marriages. Three of the five planned to bring their pregnancies to term and died because they were denied miscarriage care. But that's the problem with vague terms like \"promiscuous.\" They draw us into debates about how much women are allowed to enjoy sex before their lives are forfeited. Or how many \"good girls\" should die to punish the \"promiscuous\" ones.\nThat is the trap of misogyny. It allows women like Lila Rose or Ingrid Skop to pretend that, if you submit to the sexist order and obey all their arbitrary rules, you'll be saved. But these laws punish all women and girls: mothers and non-mothers, wives and single women, women who've had 100 partners and those who were virgins when raped. Abortion bans make crystal clear that, to the Christian right, no woman's life is worth saving. Anyone can be sacrificed, to protect their cruel patriarchal order.",

    "title": "\"An absolute disgrace\": Trump picks Kash Patel to pursue his enemies as head of the FBI",
    "author": "Charles R. Davis",
    "date": "December 2, 20",
    "text": "Kash Patel spent years preparing for this moment. Whether out of sincere devotion or just cynically acting in his own self-interest, Patel has repeatedly demonstrated his subservience to Donald Trump, from publishing a kid's book claiming the president-elect was a victim of a \"deep state\" plot to lying to congressional investigators about the Jan. 6 insurrection.\nA former aide to Devin Nunes, a California Republican who retired from Congress and now leads Trump's social media company, Truth Social, Patel is indeed best known for \"being willing to do sort of whatever Donald Trump would like him to do,\" as NBC News reporter Ryan Reilly explained in an interview with PBS. In Trump's first term, Patel's devotion saw him rise from an aide to the National Security Council to chief of staff for Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller — this, according to the Wall Street Journal, after he urged Trump to fire his previous Pentagon chief, Mark Esper, for refusing to deploy troops against Black Lives Matter protesters.\nPatel's loyalty — a willingness to embrace Trump's most extreme instincts — is why the president-elect has named him to lead the FBI. It's not just about Trump naming his own people: He already has one of his guys installed at the bureau, its current director, Christopher Wray, having been appointed to a 10-year term in 2017. But being a Trump-appointed Republican is not enough for Donald Trump anymore, who has since complained about Wray's role in the arrests of Jan. 6 rioters and the 2022 raid on Mar-a-Lago.\nPatel is not just another Trump guy, then, but properly understood as the leader of his official fan club.\n\"This is much worse than even the Matt Gaetz nomination,\" Michael Sozan, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told The New Republic's Greg Sargent. \"This is all about loyalty,\" he said, \"and this is all about another word that many of us will start using more and more: kakistocracy. That means government by the absolute least competent to run government, the most ill-qualified. That is Kash Patel.\"\nThat's not to say that Patel will merely bungle the job, Sozan noted, but that he will lead the FBI as a MAGA partisan, if confirmed. \"My reaction really is one of alarm,\" he said, describing Patel as \"one of Trump's henchmen from the very beginning, one of the most loyal of all of the loyalists in the small circle.\"\nPatel, helpfully, has been vocal about what that could mean in practice.\n“We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections. We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice,” Patel told former Trump advisor Steve Bannon last year.\nIn a more recent podcast appearance, noted by ABC News, Patel called for stripping the security clearances of intelligence officials who had warned about Russian election interference and even shutting down the FBI's headquarters in Washington, DC, and transferring its thousands of employees to field offices across the country. \"Open it up the next day as the museum to the deep state,\" he said.\nPatel has also authored a book that Trump himself described as a \"blueprint\" for his second term and a \"roadmap to end the Deep State's reign.\" As ABC News reported, that book, \"Government Gangsters,\" is an explicit call for retribution against those within the FBI who dared investigate Trump and the far right — a call not just for purges but for prosecutions \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"\nAccording to Patel, \"the FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\" Those measures include prosecuting officials involved in the FBI's investigation of ties between Russia and the Trump campaign as well as those who elected not to indict Hillary Clinton. All told, he added for clarity, the changes he envisions should make Democrats \"very afraid.\"\nPatel's MAGA posturing still needs buy-in from a majority of Senate, where Republicans' slim majority means only a handful of dissenters can derail a nomination. So far, at least, there is no sign of an open revolt. Appearing Sunday on ABC's \"This Week,\" Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., stressed that the founding fathers envisioned a \"constitutional separation\" between the president and law enforcement. That said: \"We accept that the president should have the people that he wants in his Cabinet and on his team. Every president wants that. We give them the benefit of the doubt.\"\nPeople who have worked with Patel, however, aren't as interested in deferring to the president-elect's judgment.\n“He’s absolutely unqualified for this job,\" Charles Kupperman, a deputy national security adviser during Trump's first term, told the Wall Street Journal. Patel is \"untrustworthy,\" he said, and his nomination an insult. “It’s an absolute disgrace to American citizens to even consider an individual of this nature.\"",

    "author": "Andrew O'Hehir",
    "date": "December 2, 2",
    "text": "In a year of global political turmoil, anti-incumbent fervor, across-the-board cynicism and the looming shadow of Donald Trump, voters in the Republic of Ireland appear to have delivered the most surprising verdict of all: No change, thanks. It's now clear that the two mainstream centrist parties who have controlled government in Dublin for the last five years — and who, before that, had been sworn enemies for nearly a century — will get another crack at it, presumably with some smaller coalition partner.\nBut the story of the Irish general election on Nov. 29 is not that simple, and definitely should not be understood as evidence of widespread contentment with the status quo. In Ireland, after all, stories are almost never simple, and tend to involve seemingly irrelevant tangents and extended detours into the past. This election and its non-earth-shaking result reflect a pair of contradictory truths: This island nation off the northwestern edge of Europe remains a highly distinctive place and also one heavily dependent on the global economy, and on its precarious position in between Britain and the United States.\nFor one thing, Ireland's byzantine version of ranked-choice voting — technically known as proportional representation by single transferable vote, or PRSTV — means that numerous rounds of vote-counting are necessary over multiple days to apportion all the seats in Dáil Éireann, the Irish parliament. By late Monday afternoon, after 40-plus hours of counts, all 174 seats had finally been spread out between nine different political parties and roughly two dozen independent members. But the hard part still lies ahead: Working out what combination of those parties and individual members can be stuck together into a majority coalition. There's no guarantee that a new government will be in place before Christmas.\nFor the Irish media, the weekend's most irresistible story concerned an accused Dublin gangster known as Gerry \"The Monk\" Hutch, who came startlingly close to winning one of those seats. (Whether journalists wanted him to succeed or fail is hard to say; the Irish appetite for self-mockery is nearly matched by the fear of international humiliation.) Arguably, the Monk's terrifying and/or hilarious saga offered a local corollary to the specter that's haunting all of Europe, and nowhere more than Ireland: Trump's impending second term. This decade's Irish economic boom has been driven by massive government surpluses, fueled by exploding corporate tax revenues from a handful of U.S. companies, most notably Apple, Google, Microsoft and Pfizer. As Fintan O'Toole quipped recently in the Irish Times, his country \"found the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow without even trying to catch the leprechaun.\"\nBut what happens if the evil leprechaun in D.C. turns off the magical spigot of Yank money? At the final pre-election debate last week, Ireland's three major party leaders spoke warily about a possible \"transatlantic crash\" — or, more specifically, a \"Trump shock\" — that could result from the incoming American president's unpredictable but certainly disruptive protectionist policies. Virtually everyone of voting age in Ireland can remember what happened in 2008, when the worldwide financial crisis destroyed the \"Celtic Tiger\" bubble of the '90s and left the country virtually bankrupt, dependent on European handouts and subject to years of punishing fiscal \"austerity.\"\nThat history goes a long way toward explaining Ireland's collective reluctance to embrace change, even faced with one of the most expensive housing markets in Europe and a worsening crisis in health care access. Older Irish voters largely supported the mainstream parties of the current coalition government, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who originated as murderous opposing factions during the Irish Civil War of 1922-23 and have divergent political histories, but whose present-tense policies have become almost indistinguishable. Their combined seats in the Dáil, it now appears, will be just two seats short of an overall majority, but to govern effectively they'll still need to reel in one smaller party or a handful of independents.\nIndeed, there's an unmistakable \"back to the future\" quality to this year's election results: Fianna Fáil, the long-governing and largely anti-ideological party founded by Eamon de Valera, Ireland's dominant 20th-century political figure, was virtually wiped out in the 2011 elections, having driven the national economy straight into the 2008 iceberg. Under the leadership of the avuncular, ascetic and deeply uncharismatic Micheál Martin — who will almost certainly lead the next government — Fianna Fáil has been painstakingly rebuilt and is once again the largest single party (with 48 seats in the Dáil, nine more than anyone else), although in a transformed and fragmented political landscape. Can a dramatic tale of political comeback also be boring and disappointing? If so, that one is.\nYounger Irish voters, conversely, are clearly not happy with the government parties, but failed to unite in sufficient numbers around Sinn Féin, the left-wing opposition party formerly associated with the Irish Republican Army's guerrilla warfare campaign of the '70s, '80s and early '90s. (That history still taints the party to some degree, but see above on why it's more than a bit hypocritical for the two mainstream parties to clutch their pearls.) As recently as two years ago, Sinn Féin looked poised to sweep to power following a spectacular breakthrough in the 2020 election, but after a series of missteps and internal crises it essentially finished tied for second place and will once again serve as the official opposition. Even if the \"Shinners\" manage to align with a range of smaller left-leaning parties, which is not guaranteed, a Dáil majority is nowhere in sight.\nIf the disunited Irish left was at least a borderline loser in this election, so too was Simon Harris, Ireland's youthful and energetic outgoing taoiseach (or prime minister) and the leader of Fine Gael, which is normally identified as a center-right neoliberal party but during this campaign appeared to promise almost everything to almost everyone. Mordant jokes about his politically unlucky surname aside, Harris has a vaguely Clintonite or Obama-esque manner and is given to documenting his every encounter on social media. (He has been called the \"TikTok Taoiseach,\" in a distinctively Irish blend of admiration and mockery.) After a tense exchange with a disability care worker in County Cork that clearly tarnished his image, he might want to rethink that aspect of retail politics.\nHarris clearly went into this election hoping for a popular mandate and didn't get one; his party underperformed with just 38 seats and will likely play junior partner in a governing coalition with Martin and Fianna Fáil. Then again, nobody else got much of a mandate either. Declaring something well short of victory in an admirably honest post-election press conference, Harris said, \"I think the people of Ireland have now spoken. We now have to work out exactly what they have said.\"",

Doing so would be a vindication not only of his announced anti-death penalty position but also of his Catholic faith.\nBiden is only the second practicing Catholic to serve in the Oval Office, the first being President John Kennedy. Although Biden was denied communion at a Catholic Church in South Carolina in October 2019 because of his position on abortion, his Catholicism did not play a significant role in his presidential campaign.\nWhen asked about that incident, Biden said, “I am not going to discuss that. That is just my personal life.”\nIn June 2021 the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops revived this “personal” issue when it again considered whether Biden should be able to receive communion. After Biden was elected, traditionalists among the bishops formed a working group to study the question.\nJosé Gomez, Archbishop of Los Angeles and president of the conference warned that “Our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.”\nAs his term began, other Catholic bishops “pushed to deny Biden communion due to his support of abortions. However, the Vatican issued a warning to not create division over the issue of Biden receiving communion… “\nPope Francis settled the issue by reminding the bishops that they are “pastors, not politicians.” The Pope unequivocally stated,  “I have never refused the eucharist to anyone.”\nSixty years earlier, the specter of anti-Catholic prejudice led Kennedy to address the question of how his Catholicism would affect his conduct in the White House. In April 1960, Kennedy told the American Society of Newspaper Editors , “ I am not ‘trying to be the first Catholic President’…I happen to believe I can serve my nation as President - and I also happen to have been born a Catholic.….  (T)he Catholic Church…has no claim over my conduct as a public officer sworn to do the public interest.”\nYet once he assumed the presidency, JFK continued “to keep an unmistakably Catholic spiritual routine.”\nAs to Biden, the BBC reports that “On the matter of faith, President Joe Biden is not shy. Each weekend that he is in town, he goes to Mass in Washington. A motorcade takes him on Saturday evenings or Sunday mornings to Holy Trinity, the church where President Kennedy, the only other Catholic US president, used to attend services.”\nBiden “makes the sign of the cross at public events, and his Catholicism is woven into his speeches and policies.”\nThat is why Catholic groups are now leading the way in calling on the president to do something about capital punishment before he leaves office. Spearheading this faith-based effort is the Catholic Mobilizing Network. The group reminded the president that he campaigned on abolishing the federal death penalty. It also promised to “keep praying and advocating and educating and sharing restorative practices until this system of death is dismantled and our communities flourish amid a culture of life.”\nA Catholic Review article describes the Church’s current position on capital punishment. “The  Church,“ it says, “opposes the use of the death penalty as inconsistent with the inherent sanctity of human life, and advocates for the practice’s abolition worldwide. In his 2020 encyclical ‘Fratelli Tutti,’ Pope Francis…‘stated clearly and firmly that the death penalty is inadequate from a moral standpoint and no longer necessary from that of penal justice.’”\nMoreover, six years ago, the Pope updated the Catechism of the Catholic Church’s teaching on the death penalty. The new text says that ‘[T]he Church teaches, in the light of the Gospel, that ‘the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person’….”\nThis year, announcing the Church’s 2025 Jubilee of Hope, Pope Francis again called for “the abolition of the death penalty, a provision at odds with Christian faith and one that eliminates all hope of forgiveness and rehabilitation.”\nIn the same vein, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops describess the death penalty “an attack on the dignity of the human person…because it asserts that someone is beyond redemption.” Biden has the power to bring the teaching of the Church to life and offer redemption to the forty people on the federal death row, fifty-six percent of whom are people of color.\nLike its counterpart at the state level, the federal death penalty system is rife with arbitrariness and discrimination. Some awaiting execution at the United States Correctional Facility in Terre Haute, Indiana, may be innocent or victims of glaring miscarriages of justice. As the Innocence Project warns, “Continuing the federal death penalty increases the risk of killing innocent people and deepening systemic inequalities….(T)he federal death penalty (is) error-prone, unreliable, and deeply unjust.”\nOne example of that fact is the case of Billie Allen, a 47-year-old man who was arrested at age 19 on charges of allegedly shooting a security guard during an armed robbery in St. Louis, Missouri. He has been on federal death row for twenty-seven years. During Allen’s trial, his lawyers did not bother to present evidence from an alibi witness. In addition, all the key witnesses against Allen changed their testimony dramatically from their initial recollection of events. The prosecution presented false testimony, claiming, among other things, that Billie confessed while presenting no evidence of that confession. Moreover, as Amnesty International notes, “Police recovered blood evidence from a bulletproof vest worn by one of the assailants. DNA testing excluded the murder victim and Billie Allen as sources of the blood.”\nSadly, this is an all too familiar story in capital cases at the state and federal level. President Biden knows this.\nNow is the time for him to act on that knowledge.  And if that is not enough, he should let his Catholic faith guide him to see the path to hope, forgiveness, redemption, and justice for people like Billie Allen and his death row companions.\nAs the United States Supreme Court noted almost two hundred years ago, granting clemency is an “act of grace.” Today the Catholic Church teaches that grace is “a free and undeserved gift from God.”\nNow, our devout president can give that Godly gift and spare life. There is no time to waste.",

    "text": "With some of President-elect Donald Trump’s allies promising to dismantle entire federal departments and the incoming administration laying the groundwork for mass layoffs, experts say Trump is likely to start with targeted firings aimed at making an example of specific civil servants as he tests the waters in his second administration.\nWhile the incoming Trump administration is laying the groundwork to change the rules to be able to fire civil servants en masse, Don Kettl, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, told Salon that he expects them to try making an example of a few key targets first.\n“Henry VIII didn't need to kill them all, he just needed to kill a few,” Kettl said. “He just needed some heads on spikes to make an example.”\nThe Heritage Foundation has, for example, circulated a list of targets at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services that they believe are “in league with left-wing open border groups” and that would like to see removed from the civil service. Kettl said Trump’s allies probably have similar lists for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department and other agencies the president and his allies feel were insufficiently loyal in his first term.\n“Only a fool would try to dismiss large numbers of federal employees,” Kettl said. “It’s one thing to throw sand in the gears of the federal government, it’s another to try to destroy it.”\nHowever, the first steps towards either mass dismissals or targeted example-making will be the same — reviving a policy first instituted in Oct. 2020 by an executive order creating an employment category known as “Schedule F.”\nIn the federal government, civil servants are divided into different employment categories. In 2020, Trump created Schedule F as a new classification for those whose role is “of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character.”\nFor those seeking to dismantle the administrative state or particular departments, the important part is that Schedule F civil servants would not enjoy the same employment protections afforded most civil servants and would instead be at-will employees, who could be easily dismissed.\nMany estimates have floated a figure of around 50,000 federal employees whose positions could be reclassified to Schedule F. However, the National Treasury Employee Union has warned that, according to its review of Trump-era documents from the Office of Management and Budget, the number of potential Schedule F civil servants could be much higher.\nCritics have panned the plan as a return to the spoils system, in which a political figure would reward loyalists with government appointments, and a break from merit-based civil service, which has existed in one form or another since the Pendleton Act’s passage in 1883. Since the act's passage, it has been illegal to fire merit-selected civil servants for political reasons. Schedule F would serve as a way around these protections.\nPresident Joe Biden introduced federal regulations earlier this year aimed at blocking Trump from reinstituting Schedule F through the Office of Personnel Management. Kettl said, however, that because these regulations were done through the executive branch and not legislation, Trump will probably be able to undo them very quickly.\n“Anything that is put in regulation can be removed by regulation,” Kettl told Salon. “If they wanted they could institute an interim final rule at 12:30 pm on January 20th.”\nOnce in power, Kettl explained, the question for the Trump administration will be “what kind of signals do they want to send and legally what kind of process do they want to go through?”\nRonald Sanders, a senior fellow at George Washington University’s Center for Excellence in Public Leadership, who has worked on nine presidential transitions and held positions across the federal government, told Salon that between Schedule F and the power the president maintains over the rest of the federal workforce, the incoming administration has laid the groundwork to dismiss people first and resolve outstanding issues later.\n“In a word, it's pretty complicated but if the Trump administration wanted to run roughshod over that and basically say ‘you’re fired,’ they could and let the Merit Systems Protection Board and the courts sort it all out and it's my suspicion that that is what will happen,” Sanders said.\nAccording to Sanders, however, there are reasons why the Trump administration might choose not to pursue mass layoffs out of the gate first. The first reason is that even Republicans do not want “large numbers of laid-off civil servants in their districts.”\nThe second is that the combination of the threat of Schedule F, promises to move government jobs out of Washington D.C., and the introduction of political considerations into what were once merit-based roles may be enough to engender mass resignations.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees has warned about, with the union’s policy director, Jacqueline Simon, telling the Hill that they’re expecting an “exodus.”\n“They do not want to be political appointees. They don’t want politics to interfere with any aspect of their job,” Simon said.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nSanders noted that such an exodus could be just as destructive to administrative agencies while not being subject to the same legal scrutiny as mass firings. Sanders said that, often, the people who leave the civil service voluntarily in such a scenario are those who can find the most attractive job offers elsewhere or may be near retirement, meaning an exodus would erode institutional memory in these departments.\nSeveral legal grey areas will likely need to be resolved in court and could complicate a scheme to reclassify tens of thousands of civil servants as Schedule F or to fire them. Encouraging voluntary resignations wouldn’t have the same hang-ups.\nIn Sanders’ opinion, the biggest legal issue is whether veterans would retain their right to appeal a dismissal even if their position was reclassified as Schedule F. Given that veterans account for 30% of the federal workforce, this represents a significant complication.\nSanders, who resigned from his position as chair of the Federal Salary Council over Schedule F during the first Trump administration, noted that he is an “unashamed Republican” but that he worries about “an ulterior motive” behind the staffing changes.\nWhile proponents of Schedule F say the policy is meant to ensure the federal government is responsive to elections, Sanders said he’s concerned the changes are intended to ensure loyalty and to “prevent those agencies from doing their jobs” via understaffing.\nSanders also said that, regardless of intent, introducing this level of political consideration into civil service positions stands to compromise the advice that civil servants give to the administration.\n“Civil servants are empowered to give frank and fearless advice to their political masters,” Sanders said. “You don't want them to tell a political appointee what they think that political appointee wants to hear — you want them to tell the truth.”",

    "author": "Heather Digby Parton",
    "date": "December 2, 2",
    "text": "Once upon a time, there was a Trump toadie who wrote a fatuous children's book about a good king being persecuted by an evil queen named Hillary Queenton until one day a virtuous wizard comes to his rescue and saves the day:\nOne might not think too much of such a silly little project except the \"writer\" of those books, Kash Patel, has been nominated to run the FBI in the new Trump administration. The story is a thinly veiled narrative of Patel's original claim to fame, working for former congressman Devin Nunes's House Intelligence Committee investigation into the origins of the Russia probe following the 2016 election. The books weren't written to entertain kids. They were written to cozy up to Trump and demonstrate Patel's loyalty by literally portraying Trump as a king.\nTrump hired Patel to join his National Security Council after the Nunes report came out and he quickly established himself as a direct conduit to Trump, feeding him whatever he thought he wanted to hear. According to Trump's Russia and Ukraine expert on staff, Fiona Hill, Trump even thought Patel was the man in charge of Ukraine in the White House. In reality, Patel had nothing to do with it at all. He insinuated himself into Trump's inner circle so tightly that as the term was winding down and the coup attempt was getting going after the 2020 election, Trump named him as chief of staff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher C. Miller. Trump wanted to install Patel as either the Director of the CIA or the FBI, the latter of which was met with Attorney General Bill Barr declaring that Trump would have to do it \"over my dead body.\"\nIt looks like he's finally going to get his wish, assuming the Senate goes along with the appointment.\nIt's always possible that they won't. Considering Patel's reputation for extremism and the threats he's made during the time he was out of government, one would hope that at least a handful of Republicans would say it's unacceptable. But it's a very thin hope at this point.\nAll of this assumes that Trump fires the current director Christopher Wray, his own appointee, who still has three years to go on his term. That job is unique in that it was designed to be so above partisan politics that the 10-year term can extend even beyond an 8-year presidency. Presidents have the power to dismiss them but until Trump fired James Comey because he wasn't \"loyal\" enough to drop the investigation into Russian interference, there had only been one other instance and it involved substantial ethical violations. Trump apparently plans to fire Wray for no reason at all except that he wants to install a personal henchman in the job. The idea of an apolitical FBI Director is no longer operative. From now on, they will always be seen as members of the president's team, something that really was not true until Trump. It almost seems quaint to think about it now.\nPatel has made the agenda clear with this clip that succinctly lays out what he believes his mission at the FBI would be:\nA year ago, Trump appeared before a gala of young Republicans and he looked at Patel in the crowd and said, “Get ready, Kash, get ready.” He's ready.\nDuring the Trump exile in Mar-a-lago Patel took advantage of the wingnut welfare racket and made himself some money. He worked for Trump, of course, along with various think tanks. But he also created a brand for himself (K$h) and sold those children's books and another one called \"Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy\" about his years fighting against the evil cabal that wants to destroy America. He sold K$h-branded wine, clothing and playing cards among other things. He endorsed products and even modeled them. As history professor and author of \"Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present\" Ruth Ben-Ghiat wrote on X, \"Note the K$H logo. I could update the masculinity chapter of #Strongmen with this image.\"\nThe Atlantic published the definitive profile of Patel last year, a piece by Elaina Plott Calabro that delved deeply into his early years growing up in New York and time spent working as a lawyer. He was a public defender for a while and then became a federal prosecutor. Early on he was apparently considered a bit of a showboating lawyer but generally a nice guy. But something happened along the way (beyond his burning ambition). He found himself embarrassed in the courtroom one day and developed an intense grievance against the Justice Department for allegedly failing to defend him in the press. There were other perceived slights that followed and that resentment seems to have fermented into a poisonous hostility toward the institution and the government itself. Like Trump, he believes that he's been persecuted and oppressed and is determined to wreak revenge on all those he believes have wronged him — and wronged the man to whom he has pledged his total fealty, Donald Trump.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nThat sense of persecution is what all of the Trump nominees for law enforcement, intelligence and military institutions share. Their eagerness to burn it all down is what they have in common and I would imagine that after what they're going to go through with the confirmation process and the media attention, those feelings will be even more intense. There is no reason to believe that any of them will moderate once they assume the mantle of responsibility.\nTrump is drunk with power right now. According to Axios, he has Elon Musk beside him 24/7 whispering in his ear \"pushing 'radical reform' of, well, almost everything. As he sits next to Trump discussing administration picks, Musk often asks if the person embodies 'radical reform' — massive cuts and blow-it-up-to-rebuild instincts.\" He's no doubt telling Trump how he fired everyone at the companies he bought and rebuilt them from the ground up, something which Trump, with his little family business, has never done, having only played a real boss on a reality TV show. Trump wouldn't want to look weak to the richest man in the world. He's ready to blow it all up to impress him. And Kash Patel is a loyal true believer with a readiness to do whatever it takes to get it done and get revenge.\nDonald Trump has finally found his Roy Cohn.",

    "author": "Amanda Marcotte",
    "date": "December 2, 2",
    "text": "After the Supreme Court ended federal abortion rights in 2022, there was a robust debate between pro- and anti-choice activists over whether or not banning abortion would kill women. Pro-choicers pointed to evidence, from both history and other countries, showing that abortion bans kill women. Anti-choice activists dismissed the record and pointed to toothless \"exceptions\" in abortion ban laws as \"proof\" that women could get abortions to save their lives.\nThe latter argument was frustrating not just because it was wrong but was generally offered in bad faith. Anti-abortion leaders know that abortion bans kill women. They don't care. Or worse, many view dying from pregnancy as a good thing. In some cases, it's viewed as just punishment for \"sinful\" behavior. Other times, it's romanticized as a noble sacrifice on the altar of maternal duty. But conservatives are aware that this death fetish cuts against their \"pro-life\" brand. So there was a lot of empty denials and hand-waving about the inevitable — and expected — outcome of women dying.\nWe now have another proof point that abortion bans are about misogyny, not \"life,\" as the first deaths from red state abortion bans are being reported. Instead of admitting they were wrong and changing course, Republicans are behaving like guilty liars do everywhere, and destroying the evidence. In the process, they are also erasing data needed to save the lives of pregnant women across the board, whether they give birth or not.\nProPublica has published a series of articles detailing the deaths of women in Georgia and Texas under the two states' draconian abortion bans. They most recently reported the death of Porsha Ngumezi, a 35-year-old mother of two from Texas. Ngumezi suffered a miscarriage at 11 weeks but was left to bleed to death at the hospital, instead of having the failing pregnancy surgically removed. Multiple doctors in Texas confirmed that hospital staff are often afraid to perform this surgery, however, because it's the same one used in elective abortions. Rather than risk criminal charges, doctors frequently stand by and let women suffer — or die.\nNgumezi's youngest son doesn't fully understand that his mother is dead. ProPublica reported that he chases down women he sees in public who have similar hairstyles, calling for his mother.\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only.\nA day after this story was published, the Washington Post reported that the Texas maternal mortality board would skip reviewing the deaths of pregnant women in 2022 and 2023 — conveniently, the first two years after the abortion ban went into place. The leadership claims it's about speeding up the review process, but of course, many members pointed out the main effect is that \"they would not be reviewing deaths that may have resulted from delays in care caused by Texas’s abortion bans.\"\nThis is especially noteworthy because it's become standard after one of these reports for anti-abortion activists to blame the victims and/or the doctors, and not the bans. Christian right activist Ingrid Skop, for instance, responded to Nguzemi's death by insisting \"physicians can intervene to save women’s lives in pregnancy emergencies\" under the Texas law. If she really believed that, however, she would desperately want the state maternal mortality board to review this, and other cases like it, so they could come up with recommendations for hospital staff to treat women without running afoul of the law. Strop, however, is on the Texas maternal mortality board. She was likely part of the decision to refuse to look into whether women like Nguzemi might be saved.\nSo the likeliest explanation is the simple, if brutal one: Anti-abortion activists do not want doctors to save women's lives. The current situation, where doctors are afraid to treat women and have no guidance on how to do so safely, is a status quo they are fighting to preserve. We also know this because, as Jessica Valenti reported at Abortion Every Day last week, these same activists are lobbying to rewrite current abortion bans to remove the paltry \"exceptions\" that do exist. Instead of allowing doctors to abort pregnancies that are failing, they want to force them to induce labor instead. That is not just cruel but will kill women. We know this because that's exactly how Nguzemi died; her doctor gave her a drug in hopes it would push the pregnancy out, rather than surgically remove it, as is the standard of care.\nThe Texas decision comes on the heels of a similar move in Georgia, which dismissed the maternal mortality board members to punish them for giving journalists the facts about the deaths of two other women killed by that state's abortion ban. Georgia's only slightly better than Texas, in that they aren't even bothering to pretend this isn't a cover-up. The head of the health department explicitly cited the sharing of information \"with outside individuals\" as the reason for the board being disbanded.\nThis censorship effort doesn't just impact the data about abortion ban-related deaths, either. Before 2022, both Texas and Georgia had some of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country. There's been an eye-popping 56% rise in pregnancy-related deaths in Texas over the past few years. Anyone who actually cared about women or \"life\" would want to get to the bottom of that. But people like Skop already know what the likely answer will be: Many of these women are dying because they can't get timely abortion care. Some are dying from unsafe abortions. Some are being murdered by partners who are trying to trap them with pregnancy. There's evidence that the overall quality of ob-gyn care in abortion ban states has declined, as doctors flee to legally safer environments. Some will have died, like Nguzemi, after being denied standard miscarriage management care.\nBut despite claims to be \"pro-life,\" anti-abortion activists do not care. Instead, they are on Twitter griping about how comprehensive reproductive health care access \"promotes sexual promiscuity.\"\nNo, seriously, this is their priority while women are dying.\nSkop also argued last year that abortion bans are justified because \"promiscuous behavior declines.\" It's tempting to point out that all five women whose deaths have been reported by ProPublica were in long-term relationships or marriages. Three of the five planned to bring their pregnancies to term and died because they were denied miscarriage care. But that's the problem with vague terms like \"promiscuous.\" They draw us into debates about how much women are allowed to enjoy sex before their lives are forfeited. Or how many \"good girls\" should die to punish the \"promiscuous\" ones.\nThat is the trap of misogyny. It allows women like Lila Rose or Ingrid Skop to pretend that, if you submit to the sexist order and obey all their arbitrary rules, you'll be saved. But these laws punish all women and girls: mothers and non-mothers, wives and single women, women who've had 100 partners and those who were virgins when raped. Abortion bans make crystal clear that, to the Christian right, no woman's life is worth saving. Anyone can be sacrificed, to protect their cruel patriarchal order.",

    "title": "How Republicans held the House: It's the gerrymander, stupid",
    "author": "David Daley",
    "date": "December 1, 2",
    "text": "Republicans have held the House of Representatives by an extraordinarily small margin. Partisan gerrymandering is once again a huge reason why the right will hold the chamber. The three seats nabbed by the GOP in a mid-decade gerrymander of North Carolina look like they will be the difference-maker.\nFirst the math: As of Thanksgiving weekend, the Associated Press has Republicans winning 220 seats and Democrats winning 214, with only one race still undecided. That's in California's 13th district, where it looks as if Democrat Adam Gray may defeat GOP Rep. John Duarte by a few hundred votes.\nIf the final result is a 220-215 GOP majority, that's already one of the smallest margins ever. But it's about to get smaller. Two sitting members — Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida — have been nominated or appointed to posts in the Trump administration, and Florida firebrand Matt Gaetz resigned from the House after his nomination as attorney general. (Despite withdrawing from consideration, Gaetz has said he will not return to the House in January.) So at least temporarily, the GOP will hold a minuscule edge of just 217-215.\nIn other words, Republicans’ margin of victory was just three seats, and their working majority as the next term begins will be almost nonexistent.\nAs it happens, three seats is exactly the number that Republicans engineered in their favor this cycle in North Carolina, as the result of an extreme gerrymander gifted to them by that state’s Republican-controlled Supreme Court.\nThose extra seats in the Tar Heel State, at least arguably, were enough to determine who will control the next Congress. But of course it’s not quite that simple: Those were not the only congressional districts redrawn in 2024, or the only ones gerrymandered for partisan advantage by one side or the other.\nStill, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that gerrymandering once again determined nearly everything about this year’s contest for control of the House. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson will once again hold the gavel because his drew more lines and awarded itself more clear-cut advantages.\nThey got away with this because Chief Justice John Roberts and his fellow Republicans on the Supreme Court not only refused to accept multiple proposed nonpartisan standards for determining when a gerrymander went too far, but effectively closed the federal courts to all such claims now or in the future. That has left state legislatures — themselves often the products of extreme gerrymandering — and increasingly partisan state supreme courts as the final authorities on the fairness of congressional maps.\nThere is an active campaign underway to deny this, both in mainstream and conservative media. Those employed by Rupert Murdoch’s media empire systematically ignore decades of extreme GOP gerrymanders and focus solely on New York and Illinois, where Democrats responded to Republican aggression, and the Supreme Court’s invitation, by nabbing a handful of seats for themselves. But their efforts produced fewer seats than Republicans gerrymandered in Florida alone.\nNonpartisan analysts will point to the Republican edge in the national popular vote for Congress, and even suggest that Democrats now receive a \"battleground bonus\": As of this week, they're tracking for just below 48 percent of the vote but 49.5 percent of the seats. That’s not a meaningful statistic: The aggregate total of 435 congressional races, many of them almost entirely uncompetitive (and some with no competition at all), is not a valid measurement of popular will. Overall, the congressional map has been so maximally gerrymandered that it can’t be said to mean much of anything.\nAt the moment, it appears that Republican congressional candidates have won roughly 4.4 million more votes than Democrats. That margin, although modest, may sound decisive. But it can largely be accounted for by three wildly gerrymandered states where the GOP ran up big numbers: In Florida, they had a 1.67-million vote edge, while they won by more than 1.1 million in Texas and more than 500,000 votes in both Ohio and North Carolina.\nIf districts in those purple/red states had been drawn more fairly, rather than drawn to ensure that Republicans would win 70 to 80 percent of House seats, and if competitive races had drawn better Democratic candidates, those numbers would look very different today. No one would look at the results in other nations where district lines have been so drastically manipulated and suggest that they reflect popular consensus. Neither should we.\nIn the race for Congress in these polarized times, really only one thing matters: Control the map, and you control the outcomes. Yes, the voters still cast ballots. But the winners and losers have, in many cases, been chosen already.\n*  *  *\nSo what happened in North Carolina? In this election, it was the most deep-purple state in the nation, going for Donald Trump but electing Democrats as governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and secretary of state. Democrats also have the narrowest of leads in a state Supreme Court race, and won the state’s only competitive U.S. House district.\nBut Republicans gained three U.S. House seats here before a single vote was cast, thanks to gerrymandering and a partisan Republican court.\nIn 2022, this magenta state produced a balanced delegation of seven Republicans and seven Democrats, very likely a fair representation of voter preferences. Now  Republicans will hold 10 of the 14 seats Republican — and the only surprise is that they didn’t win 11.\nThe much fairer 7-7 map was imposed in 2022 when North Carolina’s then-Democratic high court overturned an egregious gerrymander crafted by the GOP legislature.\nWhen Wesley Pegden, a mathematician and computer scientist who specializes in identifying partisan gerrymanders, examined the congressional map drawn by North Carolina Republicans in 2021, he reached a conclusion that startled even him.\nThat map wasn’t just an extreme partisan gerrymander, but one more carefully crafted to favor Republicans than 99.9999 percent of all possible maps in North Carolina. That is to say, of the 1 trillion maps created by Pegden’s supercomputer, the one drawn by the GOP was among the 00.000031 most partisan.\nThe court determined that to be a violation of the state constitution’s protections that all elections shall be free and ordered the creation of a fairer, more proportionate map — not a countervailing Democratic gerrymander, but one that ensured every vote mattered. But that equitable map disappeared almost as soon as Republicans captured a majority on the state court that fall. In an unprecedented but hardly shocking move, the partisan judges on the GOP court decided to revisit the barely year-old decision.\nThen the Republican justices went a step further than even John Roberts: They suggested that partisan gerrymandering is a “nonjusticiable” political issue — even in state courts — and returned the map to the GOP legislature to do its worst. They produced a gerrymander so one-sided that Democratic incumbents simply withdrew, surrendering before a vote was cast. Republicans immediately gained three House seats in the most 50-50 state’s most 50-50 year.\nIn a 220-215 House, those three flips make the difference between Speaker Mike Johnson or Speaker Hakeem Jeffries.\n*  *  *\nBut the issue isn’t just that the fight for control of the House was extremely close, and that those three newly gerrymandered seats proved consequential. It’s that the entire playing field was tilted decisively toward the GOP. That’s something the Murdoch hacks and the hot-take pundit brigade won’t tell you.\nIt’s true that Democrats controlled a new map in New York this year that netted them one seat. But unlike North Carolina Republicans, Democrats did not radically improve their standing in the Empire State. One district in western New York was shifted in their favor, but the partisan balance under the new map did not change more than about a percentage point in any other district. The court-ordered map from 2021 that produced a fair 16-10 map in 2022 largely remained in place. (Democrats ultimately flipped two GOP-held seats in New York, but not because of redistricting.)\nOn a national scale, Republicans retained a huge edge because they designed most of the state congressional maps themselves. Of the 435 U.S. House districts, the GOP drew 191, while Democrats drew just 71. (The rest were drawn by courts, commissions or divided governments. Seven states have just one House member.)\nMuch of the existing GOP bias — such as the 6-2 delegation from Wisconsin — remains intact from redistricting after the 2010 census. As part of the GOP’s REDMAP operation, Republicans targeted just over 100 state legislative seats that year in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and elsewhere.\nWhen Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, he carried Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. But thanks to their new gerrymanders, Republicans controlled the House delegations from all those states — and it wasn’t close. The GOP won 64 of 94 districts in those states, an astounding 68 percent of the seats in states Mitt Romney lost. That makesi t abundantly clear why Republicans comfortably held the House in that election, 234-201. If those 94 seats in Obama states had simply split evenly between the two parties, Democrats would have won a 218-217 majority.\nState courts in Florida, Virginia and Pennsylvania helped push maps toward fairness in the latter part of the 2010s. In the 2018 midterms, those maps, along with unexpected wins in a handful of red-state districts (in Kansas, Utah and Oklahoma) helped Democrats retake the House. It wasn’t that they defeated gerrymandering in 2018, more like they worked around it; the GOP’s bespoke maps in North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin held firm.\nDuring the 2021 cycle, following the Supreme Court’s abdication, both parties looked to lock in every advantage they could.\nThe nonpartisan Brennan Center at NYU Law School suggests that there is a 16-seat edge for Republicans nationwide, and that the “bias in this cycle’s maps strongly favors Republicans due primarily to aggressive gerrymandering in GOP strongholds in the South and Midwest.”\nRepublicans controlled more states thanks to previous gerrymanders, and had more and better opportunities. Democrats worked around the margins in states they controlled, adding three seats in Illinois, one in Oregon and another in New Mexico.\nThose are the only gerrymanders Fox News or the New York Post will ever tell you about. In reality, Republicans got most of that back in Florida alone, nabbing an additional four seats. They added seats in Texas, grabbed one in Tennessee by cracking the largely Democratic city of Nashville in half and dividing it among two red districts, and wiped competitive seats that the Democrats won in 2018 in Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City and Indianapolis completely off the map.\nThanks to the courts, the Wisconsin gerrymander remained intact. Federal courts slow-walked racial gerrymandering lawsuits that helped the GOP hold seats in Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama.\nIn Ohio, the state Supreme Court twice declared GOP maps unconstitutional, but lawmakers defied a court order and enacted them anyway. In Arizona, Republicans played a brazen long game to capture the state’s supposedly independent commission with party loyalists, flipping a balanced map that produced a 5-4 Democratic delegation in 2020 into a 6-3 GOP edge in 2022, even as voters elected a Democratic governor and U.S. senator. They also played hardball in Iowa, undermining the state's nonpartisan commission and allowing the GOP to push one additional seat largely into their column.\nAll of which is to say: Both parties have won House seats through gerrymandering, but the Republicans have a clear advantage, certainly larger than the three or four seats that will determine control of the chamber.\nOn a national map with two dozen swing seats, Republicans have baked in about a 16-seat advantage. In practice, that means Democrats must win almost every competitive seat to have a legitimate shot at the majority. That’s not impossible; horserace analysts and party fundraisers will keep on telling you it can be done. But it’s now more difficult than ever.\n*  *  *\nNone of this is to claim that Democrats \"really won\" this year's election, or that they should control the House in 2025. Obviously, election results this November tilted rightward. But when you take into account gerrymanders by both parties, the GOP margin in the 2024 election is less than the advantage Republicans netted through redistricting.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nAs stated earlier, the “national popular vote” for the House — which once aligned more closely to the national will — has become an entirely bogus measure. More than three dozen House races had no major-party challenger and more than two dozen had no challenger, period. That inevitably distorts the national totals because few votes, sometimes none at all, were cast for non-incumbents in those districts. And that’s without counting the hundreds of lopsided districts where both major parties fielded candidates but the results were preordained and voters barely paid attention.\nConsider North Carolina, where Trump defeated Kamala Harris by 51 to 47.8 percent, a margin of 184,000 votes. Democrat Josh Stein won the gubernatorial race easily, thanks to a scandal-plagued opponent, but every other statewide race was extremely close. Democrats took the most important offices by about two points each, while Republicans won tight races for auditor, state treasurer and insurance commissioner.\nBut only one of North Carolina’s 14 congressional districts was competitive. Two were drawn in such lopsided fashion that they generated no Democratic challenger at all. In the other 11, losing parties ran sacrificial lambs with zero chance of winning, who generated little electoral heat. More than 270,000 voters who cast a ballot for either Harris or Trump didn’t even bother to vote for a U.S. House candidate — even though that was the next item on the ballot.\nIn the “popular vote” for the House in North Carolina, Republicans had an advantage of about 540,000 votes. That’s a garbage statistic, which artificially inflates the GOP’s national total through uncompetitive races based on maps the party drew for itself. Add those garbage statistics to the ones from Ohio, Texas, Florida, Maryland, Illinois, and all the other states with lesser gerrymanders by one side or the other, and what you get is a gigantic trash heap.\nThere are better ways to do this. A more proportional system, such as that proposed in the Fair Representation Act sponsored by Reps. Don Beyer, D-Va., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., would combine multi-member districts and ranked choice voting to un-gerrymander every state, and generate more balanced results, even in largely one-party states like Massachusetts or Tennessee. It would create a more accurate portrait of the people’s will, everywhere.\nUntil we have a national fix, or a Supreme Court that is less determined to help Republicans win elections, we are stuck with the mess that we have: A nationally gerrymandered map of blue and red states with little incentive for either party to play fair. Within that mess, Republicans have locked in control of more purple states than Democrats because of their aggressive redistricting a decade ago — and because they are willing to run roughshod over state constitutions and to disregard the rulings of state supreme courts.\nWe can call this a lot of things. We can’t call it fair, balanced or democratic. It may seem reasonable that Republicans will control the House after a Republican year. But gerrymandering made their victory far more likely, by narrowing the map to an ever-shrinking number of swing seats. We still live in a nation where those who draw the lines, not the voters, largely determine who wins and who loses.",

    "text": "Nearly one month later, the Democratic Party and the pundits and other politics experts are continuing to study the wreckage of the 2024 election. They are asking themselves how this could have possibly happened. How could we have been so wrong in assessing the country’s mood? They need to quickly come up with the correct answer because they are running out of time. Trump has promised a campaign of revenge and retribution against his perceived enemies. He is not kidding.\nThe public opinion polls suggested that the election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump would be very close — and more specifically that Harris would be much more competitive, if not the victor. Of course, this did not happen. The fabled Democratic blue wall was easily smashed by Trump and his MAGA movement. Trump also made in-roads as he won support from key parts of the Democratic Party’s base across the country. This hinted at a larger trend as Kamala Harris and the Democrats experienced a collapse of support among a wide range of voters. The result: Trump would increase his support by more than two million votes as compared to the 2020 election. By comparison, Harris received seven million fewer votes than President Biden did in 2020.\nIn a recent essay at The Conversation, historian and media critic W. Joseph Campbell offers this assessment:\nCampbell continues:\nAt the Columbia Journalism Review, Meghnad Bose makes this intervention about how the news media chooses to present the polls in the context of other information:\nHere is one of the main challenges of public opinion polls, even high-quality ones and how the news media uses them: public opinion polls represent a snapshot in time that gains more meaning in hindsight after we see how and if they were correct and accurate or not relative to the final results of a given election. Polls usually do not explain how and why a given person (or cohort) feels about a given issue and their reasoning for that conclusion.\nIn a global moment of discontent with democracy and the order of things, the \"why?” of emotions and political decision-making among the mass public are of paramount importance. Populism, in its most raw form, is collective action based on shared emotions, meaning, reality and feelings of community and collective experience(s) in service to a leader(s) and “the cause.” To ignore this aspect of politics is to overlook one of the main drivers of Trump’s enduring power and appeal, specifically, and that of the MAGA movement and American fascism, more generally.\nIn total, what the mainstream news media and political class need is a better understanding of what social theorists describe as “life worlds,” the subjective reality that a given individual(s) uses to make sense of the world and which develops relative to material circumstances and relationships. As a whole, the mainstream news media, the political class and other elites generally assume that their understanding of reality and “the facts” — and of course what constitutes “rational behavior” — are universal. They are not.\nIn a recent article, Salon staff reporter Russell Payne offers this important example of the dynamic dogging Democrats:\nSuch hubris and arrogance are one of the main reasons why the mainstream news media (especially the centrists and the liberals and progressives who have a platform in the legacy news media) and the Democrats and their consultants were caught so off guard by Trump’s win in 2024 (and also in 2016).\nTo that point, focus groups revealed a much different story, one that I would suggest was a better predictor of Trump’s win than a “conventional wisdom” born of obsessive readings and interpretations of the public opinion polls. For example, in a Nov. 3 column at The New York Times ominously (and presciently) titled “Our 61 Focus Groups Make Me Think Trump Has a Good Chance of Winning\", Patrick Healey writes:\nThe Times continues:\nIn September, The New York Times shared the results of another focus group that also signaled great trouble ahead for Kamala Harris and the Democrats:\nIn this much-discussed example, one voter told The Philadelphia Inquirer that he knows that Donald Trump is like “Hitler”, but he supported him anyway. This is only one man's explanation, but it is still very insightful and illustrative of the broader trends that led to Trump's victory and Harris' defeat.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nOf course, this is not the ideal model of civic virtue, reasoning, “rational behavior” or placing that thing known as “democracy” — however vaguely defined and (mis)understood by the public — above all other concerns that the Democrats, mainstream news media and responsible political class assumed would be a winning and self-evident message to the American voting public. Moreover, and perhaps even more troubling for what it portends about the enduring power of American fascism and authoritarianism, is how this Pennsylvania voter's reasoning for why he supported Trump is a damning indictment of the country’s larger culture. For many Americans, “Hitler” and “fascism” are just words and images that have no factual or reality-based historical grounding or meaning. This is a function of a culture of distraction and amusement and how so many Americans live in a type of survival mode where larger concerns about society and the future are overridden by the individual and the immediate. The legitimacy crisis facing America’s (and the world’s) democratic and other governing institutions is very real and will not be dissipating any time soon.\nAs social theorist Henry Giroux writes in a recent essay at CounterPunch:\nSuch an environment is toxic for a healthy democracy. Desperate people yearn for strongmen and other such autocrats and dictators who promise easy solutions to complex problems. If one wants a parsimonious or unifying explanation for Trump and the MAGA movement’s “surprise” victory in the 2024 election it is that.\nUltimately, the Democrats, the mainstream news media and other defenders of \"the institutions\" will find few truly meaningful answers in polling or focus groups or some other tool or measure in isolation.\nInstead, they need to look at the larger picture of the social forces and emotions and meaning – and crisis – that explains how we “the Americans” got here and hopefully how we can escape the Age of Trump.",

    "title": "\"Wicked\" reminds us we'd all better be ready to defy gravity. Especially Black women",
    "author": "Melanie McFarland",
    "date": "December 2, 2",
    "text": "The “Wicked” nation is still relatively young, like the musical itself. This year marks its 21st anniversary on Broadway, and the touring version has consistently crisscrossed the country since its earliest days, thrilling audiences with its revisionist version of L. Frank Baum’s  “The Wizard of Oz.”\nIn this telling of the American fairy tale, the hero edit goes to Elphaba Thropp, the naturally gifted sorceress who eventually becomes the Wicked Witch, memorialized by her school-days friend at Shiz University by Galinda Upland. Galinda is perky, blonde, self-involved and universally adored, presumably from the moment she trilled into the world.\nElphaba, in contrast, is a naturally talented sorceress whose green skin led her father to reject her from the moment she was born. Their shared journey makes “Wicked” a magnet for like-minded souls drawn to its theme of misfit friendships.\nWhat I noticed when I saw the touring production quite recently, is that the theater was packed with mothers, sisters and daughters. Many of the younger members swathed in sequins and tulle skirts. Relatively few chose to cosplay Elphaba. Regardless, it was an ecstatic communal event with many cheers, laughter and enthusiastic applause.\nSo why was I so livid as I left the theater?\nThat’s a rhetorical question. I know why. It has nothing to do with the performers or Stephen Schwartz and Winnie Holzman’s libretto, which I was familiar with long before seeing the stage production for the first. My anger was a matter of timing.\nThe first half of the “Wicked” movie adaptation marks a place in our cultural history similar to how “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” landed in theaters weeks after Donald Trump first won the presidency in 2016.\nThat shock disillusioned progressives who’d bought into the fantasy that Barack Obama’s two presidential terms signaled an evolution to a more equitable future for America.\n“Right now hope looks foolish,” Salon’s Amanda Marcotte wrote back then. “People who give in to hope start chasing impossible dreams.” To that, Felicity Jones’ Jyn Erso reminded her \"Rogue One\" compatriots that “rebellions are built on hope.” Jyn was right, but she didn’t live to see it.\n“Wicked” is an allegory about manipulated history. Thanks to the 1939 movie version of “The Wizard of Oz,\" Americans know the same story Oz’s citizens were told about Elphaba, all of us accepting that propaganda as gospel.\nMy husband and I watched the theatrical performance on the Sunday that followed an election that reminded me yet again how much disdain America has for women, especially Black women.\nThe actor playing Elphaba in the stage production I attended isn’t Black. Neither is Idina Menzel, who originated the role on Broadway, with Kristin Chenoweth as Galinda/Glinda. Casting Cynthia Erivo to play her in the movie, though, meets a moment that wasn’t as in our faces in 2003 as it is right now.\nElphaba’s existence is a miracle reframed as an obscenity. She is extraordinary in every way, yet the world demands that she dim her ability and treat her intellect as if it were an offense.\nEven her laugh is taken as something sinister, until she’s granted acceptance, temporarily, thanks to the normalizing endorsement of Ariana Grande’s limber, lithe, perky and bubbly blonde Galinda, swinging her golden locks with a “toss, toss.”\nCynthia Erivo as Elphaba and Ariana Grande as Glinda in \"Wicked\" (Universal)“Kamala Harris is a woman who has had her racial identity questioned, has had her name made fun of, has been demeaned for not having biological children, has been accused of sleeping her way to the top, and has been degraded for her laugh, her clothing style — all of the things that are completely irrelevant to her qualifications and her achievements,” said my colleague Mary Elizabeth Williams in her trenchant video response the election results.\n“. . . What do you think that says to us as women?” Williams added. “What do you think that says to survivors of sexual violence? What do you think it says to women of color?”\nThis is what whizzed through my mind as I watched “Wicked” play out onstage: According to NBC News and CBS News exit polls, white women voted for Trump 53% to 45% in 2024. That’s not much of a shift from 2020 when 55% supported Trump, or 2016 when 52% supported Trump.\nIn the last two presidential elections, and certainly in the most recent, there was the perfunctory celebration of Black women saving democracy with white women promising this time they’d do better.\nBut Black women had to know deep down that neither the Galindas nor the Glindas would switch sides for a leader who promised to do better for and by all of us, and for democracy. It’s all right there in the lyrics of “Defying Gravity”: “I hope you're happy, I hope you're happy, too,” Elphaba sings to Glinda. “I hope you're proud, how you would grovel in submission.” Elphaba seems not terribly surprised, just disappointed. Some of us know the feeling.\nAnyway, that’s how the first act ends. By the close of the show, Elphaba and Glinda have mended their friendship – and here’s the part that I think set me off: Elphaba apologizes to Glinda which, in the musical, Glinda does not reciprocate. Not long afterward Dorothy comes on the scene with a bucket of water, etcetera, etcetera.\nSince the movie and musical open with the Munchkins stomping out a number that celebrates the Wicked Witch’s demise, this isn't blowing anything for you. “No one mourns the wicked!” the Oz folk triumphantly harmonize. But, yes – the whole message rubbed me the wrong way.\nMusicals are an emotionally charged art form by design, but “Wicked” is next level. All the pregame excitement for, and bracing to be annoyed about, impromptu sing-a-longs in movie theaters is proof.\nI could be wrong, but I don’t remember many anticipatory social media posts of teens warming up to croon “Tonight” during screenings of Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story” revival. Then again, most of Tony and Maria’s fans have aged out of any extrovertive display that doesn’t involve a martini or three.\n“Wicked,” in contrast, is a series of duets and solos about friendship, loathing and a friendship that blossoms out of loathing – the series arc of girlhood’s affections. I imagine that younger fans ardently connect Glinda and Elphaba's inconstant relationship to the ups and downs of their own.\nYouthful readings of movies, music and TV are simpler. Elphaba is a power fantasy for outcasts. Glinda is confident and fashionable and hilariously blind to her egomania. Later she realizes with great regret, and too late, the corrosive cruelty in which she participated for her benefit, carried out by a talentless, ordinary man who demonizes her friend purely for political benefit. But at least they find their way to liking each other again.\nJeff Goldblum as The Wizard of Oz and Michelle Yeoh as Madam Morrible in \"Wicked\" (Universal Studios)\nFriendship gained and lost isn’t the only theme of “Wicked,” but it is the glittering text to the subtext of discrimination, dehumanization and subjugation in a realm where a conman from Kansas fools an overcredulous population into believing he’s a wizard.\n“When I first got here, there was discord and discontent,” The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) explains to Elphaba when he thinks she shares his addiction to being a celebrity. “And where I come from, everyone knows: the best way to bring folks together, is to give them a really good enemy.\"\nErivo is one the finest singers of our time, slaying the role of Aretha Franklin before stepping into Elphaba's chunky boots. But her Blackness calls attention to Elphaba’s specific othering in a way the audience might ignore when white actors wore her pointed hat.\nThe witch’s green skin originated in the 1939 movie. In the book Baum merely set her wickedness as antipodal to Dorothy Gale’s pluck and goodness.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nDirector Jon M. Chu’s Oz is a technicolor fantasy and multicultural wonderland, with major characters played by Black, brown and Asian actors – notably Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible, the Dean of Sorcery at Shiz and, at first, Elphaba’s champion. Eventually she becomes Elphaba’s enemy, although she isn’t the first to claim that title.\nGrande’s Galinda leaps into that part with aplomb. Elphaba flings her hatefulness back at her until the day perpetually rosy Galinda, in a two-part act of sabotage, offers the plain-dressed Elphaba the hat that becomes her signature look, knowing the rest of their Shiz classmates will mercilessly tease her.\nAriana Grande as Glinda in \"Wicked\" (Universal)But Elphaba mistakes it for a peace offering, and in a lopsided exchange gives Galinda the thing she wants most, an entry to an exclusive world. So Galinda cashes in some of her cred to bestow some normalizing popularity on her green-skinned classmate who, in one night, becomes her friend.\nIf you are woman of color who counts among her former friends a Galinda-type, what happens next may seem familiar. It may have somewhat prepared you for the way things turned out on Nov. 5. As Elphaba’s profile rises, Galinda glides with her in her wake . . . until the moment comes that forces Miss Upland to choose between joining her BFF in righteous exile and increasing her popularity on a gargantuan scale.\nAssuming you’ve seen “The Wizard of Oz” — and more people have than read Gregory Maguire’s 1995 novel, which inspired the musical – you already know what decision she makes.\n“Her green skin is but an outward manifestorium of her twisted nature,” says the person calling for Elphaba to be hunted. “This distortion . . . this repulsion . . . this Wicked Witch.”\nElphaba is none of those things. We’ve seen that. Glinda knows it too. But obeying the man in charge works out better for Glinda. Oz's history proves it. So does American history.\nThe beauty of “Wicked” the movie is that it ends on the story’s highest note, with Elphaba choosing to resist and fly free instead of complying with a corrupt government. The CGI glamour throughout “Wicked” can be intoxicating, but in this climax it enables Erivo’s Elphaba to soar like a comet and declare her independence with exhilarated determination:\nIt’s a temporary victory. It’s also a gift to the disenchanted who need reminding that there’s nothing new about the story we’re living in, that the people who stand to be harmed more than most will still grasp for the popular choice if it means they get to ride in a pretty bubble. But I’d much rather be like the pariah holding on to magic in her bag and a broom that’s no longer meant for cleaning up other people’s messes.\n\"Wicked\" is now playing in theaters nationwide.",

    "title": "How \"Queer\" writer Justin Kuritzkes told a love story through \"the language of addiction\"",
    "author": "Gary M. Kramer",
    "date": "December 1, 2",
    "text": "Justin Kuritzkes has written only two feature films, both this year, both for director Luca Guadagnino, and both very gay films. First is “Challengers,” which was out in April, and now “Queer,” an adaptation of William S. Burroughs’ novel.\n“Queer” depicts both the horniness of Lee (Daniel Craig) — Burroughs’ alter ego — as well as the haziness of his heroin addiction. Lee’s compulsions overlap when he meets Eugene Allerton (Drew Starkey) in 1950s Mexico. In Allerton, Lee finds someone he wants to have sex with and do drugs with. The film shows how the relationship between these two men develops over time. Although Lee does not hide his attraction for Allerton, which intensifies, when the men do have sex, it is messy, explicit, complicated and queer.\nIn an effort not to lose this handsome young man, Lee convinces Allerton to join him on a road trip through Latin America in search of yagé, a drug Lee craves. Eventually, they end up in the jungle with Doctor Cotter (Lesley Manville), tripping their balls off before things get more surreal.\nKuritzkes takes some liberties with the source material, but “Queer” succeeds in capturing both the spirit of Burroughs as Lee, and Craig honors the work by giving a fantastic, fully committed performance.\nThe writer spoke with Salon about adapting Burroughs, working with Guadagnino and making “Queer.”\nWhat can you say about adapting Burroughs, which must have been a challenge?\nThis was the first time I ever adapted anything. Everything I had written prior to this, whether it was my plays, my novels or “Challengers,” was all original stuff. I was on the set for “Challengers,” and one day Luca just handed me this book and said, “Read this tonight and tell me if you will adapt it for me.” I read it that night and immediately said yes even though I had no idea, really, how I was going to make it into a film.\nBut, because I was in Boston with Luca making this other movie, we got to spend a lot of time talking about the vision of “Queer,” and the cinematic possibility of the book before I even started writing. For me, the first job I gave myself was being a good reader. I tried to pay attention to what was fundamental in the book so I could figure out what would be fundamental in the movie. Knowing Burroughs' work, through his other books “Naked Lunch” or “The Yagé Letters,” I had a preconceived notion of what the world of Burroughs was like, narratively. I was kind of shocked when I read “Queer,” to find that it was, for the most part, a fairly straightforward love story that operated on the level of psychology and in a fairly linear way. That was the drumbeat for the story.\nQueer (A24\nHad you read much of Burroughs' work before “Queer”?\nI had, but I had not read this book. I was surprised when I read it that it felt like a real departure from the rest of his work. It feels like this is an outlier, but at the same time, it is like the most Burroughs book he wrote.\nI know you are married to Celine Song (“Past Lives”), but let me ask you a question asked in the film: “Are you queer?” You have written two very queer films for Luca. Can you talk about your working relationship with him and making queer cinema?\nOn principle, my impulse is to say that is a dangerous question to ask and can put people in compromised positions. My impulse in one sense is to say, “It’s no one’s business what anybody’s private life is like.” On the other hand, I’m well aware that I’ve written two movies now for one of the most preeminent queer directors in cinema. Luca is a giant in queer cinema. And one of those movies is literally called “Queer,” so it doesn’t behoove anyone for me to be coy. I am straight and don’t claim any queer identity for myself. But at the end of the day, queer culture is culture, and in a movie like this, you focus on the parts of it that are universal. The specific milieu or situation or circumstances of the characters, you obviously have to consider and pay attention to and do research where you need to.\nBut what was happening psychologically between Lee and Allerton was something I had total access to through the sharpness of Burroughs' writing. On the level of feeling comfortable writing a movie like this, it was probably not a movie I would write out of the blue without a source or adapt it for anyone but Luca. But I saw my job as being a kind of medium between these two brilliant queer artists, one whom I knew well and knew as a collaborator, and one who I was never going to know because he is not around, and all I have is the stuff he left behind. I saw my job as opening a channel between these two people. That felt like a tremendous honor. This was a book that Luca read as a teenager and wanted to make for a long time. It felt like this tremendous responsibility to try to write Luca this movie he had been dreaming about.\nThe film builds tremendous sexual tension, as did your previous film this year, “Challengers.” How do you convey that homoeroticism on the page and then get it onto the screen? How explicit did you want to get?\nThe book is very coy in some sense about the intimate scenes between Lee and Allerton. When Luca and I were first discussing what the possibility of the movie could be, we were clear early on we did not want to be coy. That was not because of any sensational reason. It was because there was drama happening in the intimate scenes between Lee and Allerton. There was something being revealed about their character and their dynamic. In those intimate scenes, there is something at stake. Because of that, it is necessary action. It was important to me, as I was writing, that that it always be revealing of character and the shifting dynamics. I found myself having to be very specific in those scenes as I was writing them because I know I had to ask actors to be brave enough to perform it. If you are not brave enough to write it, why would you ask people to be brave enough to do it?\nA middle section portrays the drug use and Lee being junk sick. What decisions did you make in how to present those moments?\nIt is all part of who this character is. It’s true of Burroughs that heroin was a part of his life for his entire life. The context of Lee being in Mexico is because being a drug addict in the U.S. makes him a criminal. It is why he ended up in Mexico. Drugs are the reason why Lee and Allerton met. They are sort of parallel facets of his character, rather than overlapping ones.\nI think the language of addiction is present in the way Lee understands the language of intimacy. It felt necessary to treat that with a degree of frankness and see it objectively.\nDaniel Craig, Drew Starkey and Lesley Manville in \"Queer\" (A24)\nThe film shifts to a different tone as Lee and Allerton go into the jungle. Can you talk about those scenes and Doctor Cotter?\nDoctor Cotter shows up towards the end of the book, but in the book, they get to Doctor Cotter’s hut and think they are going to get the yagé, but that possibility is closed, and they return to civilization not having gotten what they came for. When we first discussed what we could do for the movie, something that was exciting to both me and Luca was if you think of the book as opening the door and quickly closing it, we wanted to see what was on the other side, and have the characters actually step through and get what they were looking for. We wanted to see what that would do to their dynamic and how they would each deal with it. I know that the film was going to go there even as I was writing the earlier sections, which are more or less faithful to the book.\nWhen it comes to the character of Doctor Cotter, I find her incredibly fascinating, and she got even deeper and richer when we cast Lesley Manville. I ended up writing more material for Doctor Cotter because I knew Lesley was doing it. It was exciting to think about her as a brilliant and crazed doctor living out in the jungle with her husband developing these medicines that she thinks are going to make her a millionaire. I was excited to watch Lesley do that. All the work that went into building that character is just so exquisite.\nFinally, the film gets surrealistic and even incorporates the William Tell scene from Burroughs' own life. What can you say about the film’s imagery and symbolism?\nThat is part of what the film and what the book invites, is for people to think about all of that symbolism and internalize it and do what they will with it. A lot of it came from Burroughs and a lot of it came from Luca and his visual grammar that he wanted to bring to the movie, and that was stuff we talked about before I started writing. The visual language of centipedes throughout the film. That is all in Burroughs, but also in Luca’s mind. That kind of stuff was fun to thread through the script as we tried to build the symbolic vocabulary of the movie. Burroughs is full of all that stuff. He is a very evocative writer in that way.\n“Queer” is now playing in select cities with nationwide expansion to follow",

    "title": "Alanis Morissette's “Ironic”: Putting an end to the debate over whether it is or isn’t",
    "author": "Megan Volpert",
    "date": "November 29, 2",
    "text": "The prevailing notion is that the Alanis Morissette's song “Ironic” is not ironic at all, but instead simply full of bummers, is a pedantic and sad case of unimaginative people wielding sexist bias to dismiss Alanis as dumb. Alanis has admitted that the lyrics to “Ironic” prove she didn’t properly grasp the meaning of the word. We’re not here to rehash verdicts already rendered. She f**ked it up and said so. We’re here to examine the implications of that f**kup, to explain why it was usefully so very on the nose for the '90s and to argue that the song is redeemable while the critique of it is not.\nThe commonly understood definition of irony, where what is said is literally the opposite of what is meant, comes to us from Greek philosophers. This is verbal irony, or in '90s parlance, sarcasm. It’s saying, “Oh, yay, I get to flunk another math test this week,” when what you mean is that you are freaked out about your consistently terrible grades in math class. Situational irony is when what happens is the opposite of what is expected to happen. It’s when you somehow get an A on that math test despite being utterly unprepared for it. Sometimes, the math teacher acknowledges situational irony by asking you to stay after class so he can accuse you of cheating, since neither of you can believe you suddenly aced a test by any other method.\nBy the measure of the Greeks, the song “Ironic” is a technical failure because it serves bummers in lieu of true opposites. Yet Alanis is far from dumb, and a case-by-case nitpicking of the lines is as micro as Socrates playing devil’s advocate in response to every little thing his students say, while the song is operating at a macro or meta level more akin to Aristotle’s notion of infinite regress. The fable goes that someone asks what holds up the earth in space and is told the planet rests on the back of a giant turtle. So, the question then is what that giant turtle rests on, and the answer of course is another giant turtle. It’s turtles all the way down into the abyss. Alanis is interested in these mystic “slippery slope” moments, these big-ticket human crises that feel apocalyptic yet idiotic. She didn’t spend any time checking whether the chardonnay or Mr. Play It Safe were properly aligned with the rules of irony. No admiration from Socrates then, but perhaps plenty from Aristotle.\nWe don’t know whether Alanis read or cared about the Greeks, but she’s made hundreds of mentions of Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung and how his pioneering theories of analytical psychology deeply influence her songwriting. Jung died in the early '60s before irony began trending as a fundamental human relation. Although he had no explicit definition of irony, he theorized that humans are strongly influenced by symbols expressed through myths and dreams or other cultural touchstones. In his emphasis on the gap between our surface words or actions and their deeper psychological meanings or feelings, Jung would probably say that irony questions and subverts normative cultural narratives. He would understand irony as an archetype drawn from our collective unconscious.\nThis is the way in to grasping how Alanis does effectively utilize irony. She has a deep understanding of and a postmodern comfort with cognitive dissonance, with lyrics that describe the affective landscape of the gap between our gestures and expectations. Sadly, one of the best defenses of “Ironic” comes to us from Vince Vaughn. The opening sequence of the 2013 film \"The Internship,\" which Vaughn wrote and starred in, has “Ironic” blasting in a convertible with the top down as Vaughn and Owen Wilson head out for a night on the town. Wilson is dismayed that this song is on Vaughn’s “get psyched” playlist and they debate it. “I defy you to crush this chorus and not get psyched,” Vaughn says. Wilson does so and then is indeed psyched. One hundred percent of the examples given in “Ironic” are bummers, and yet the lyrics close with a reminder that life has a funny way of helping you out.\nThat’s Barthesian irony. Roland Barthes was a French literary critic who worked in semiotics, the study of signs and symbols, just as Jung did. Compared to the Greeks’ understanding of it, Barthesian irony is less concerned with opposites. He simply defined it as a rhetorical device involving a double meaning. The discrepancy between the two meanings generates ambiguity and this ambiguity can push a listener to interpret the lyrics of “Ironic” in a new way. You can sing about all the bummers in “Ironic,” but do so joyfully, embracing even the hard parts of life as inevitable or necessary. Our struggles help us out. Framing something bad as somehow yielding something good is a subversive move when it allows multiple, conflicting interpretations of a song at the same time. It offers ten thousand spoons instead of one knife. This multiplication of meaning is a form of linguistic play, a turning to imagine what one might do with the unexpected bounty of ten thousand spoons. When critics dismiss “Ironic” as made up of a failed set of literal opposites, they miss the point: irony is a rhetorical whirlwind that disrupts language and undermines normativity.\nDualistic dismissals of “Ironic” foreclose its vivacious, nonbinary complexity. “Irony does not involve the simple substitution of the opposite for the literal meaning,” said Barthes in \"Elements of Semiology.\" “It is a form of semantic pivot which overturns the hierarchy of language, bringing into play the signified and the signifier, the explicit and the implicit, the internal and the external, the present and the absent.” By Barthesian standards, “Ironic” is ironic. This is especially true when Alanis questions whether life can be a little too ironic. The Greeks conceived of irony as pass/fail, but Alanis considers irony to be a spectrum, and she slides from side to side across the examples in the song in a manner that is definitely akin to Barthesian play. The most critics can really claim is that she didn’t do so on purpose.\nTo the extent that her intentions are discernible, I agree that they should matter to our discussion here. Barthes expects irony to be done deliberately. Fortunately, life does seem to have a funny way of helping Alanis out. After she realized her erroneous deployment of the concept, she was given a shot at redemption in the opportunity to carefully consider how to position “Ironic” in the \"Jagged Little Pill\" Broadway musical. This was an epic chance to reject, remedy, or advance criticisms of the original album. Older and wiser Alanis did not throw the moment away, but instead positioned the critique itself within the musical to add further layers of irony. The plot of the musical updates the context of the lyrics by putting them into a writing workshop as a poem, with other characters criticizing the poem’s lack of irony.\n“Ironic” is the fifth of 10 songs in Act 1, and its beautiful reversal hunts the hunters. It laughs them right off the stage, not meanly or defensively — because they are somewhat correct about the lack of opposites in the song — but instead with a disregard for any criticism that would tend to deny the overall gorgeousness of the poem on the basis of a technicality. Rachel Syme’s foreword to the musical book says that this version of “Ironic” turns it into “an inside joke about poetic license and grammatical errors.” The song and the scene are given to Frankie, described in the musical book as an “aspiring poet, president and founder of SMAAC (The Social Movements and Advocacy Committee), proud Black woman, bisexual feminist, perennial troublemaker, revolutionary in the making.” She’s also adopted. SMAAC only has two members at first, Frankie and her best friend/girlfriend, Jo. Frankie makes mistakes but is also a strong advocate for others.\nThe Writer’s Workshop classroom at Frankie’s high school is found in Act 1, Scene 5. The teacher says, “Frankie will read her piece, and we will then use constructive criticism to help her shape it into something brilliant-ish.” Frankie describes her writing, the lyrics to “Ironic,” as “an essay-poem-story-type” thing. After the first verse, Alanis included a footnote in the musical book stating, “I get it when people mock these lyrics. The real irony of all time for me is that I’m usually the grammar police. I’m usually the one going, ‘Ah, that’s not the King’s English.’” In the musical, one classmate interrupts Frankie to say, “That’s not irony, that’s just, like, s**tty.” Another classmate says it fails according to the definition of irony present in Greek tragedy. One more classmate tries to improve upon the plane crash scenario with the old man, to make it actually ironic by turning him into an airplane mechanic instead of a guy who was afraid to fly. Frankie’s love interest, Phoenix, consoles her by saying these critics are projecting, that Frankie is “obviously a great writer and their only defense is to be hyperliteral.” With renewed confidence, Frankie continues to sing as Phoenix duets on the remaining verses.\nIn this version of “Ironic,” Frankie sings, “It’s like meeting the boy of my dreams and then meeting his . . .” Phoenix finishes the line with “. . . I’m not seeing anyone.” The album finishes it with “. . . beautiful wife.” The last time I saw Alanis live, she finished it with “. . . beautiful husband,” making it explicitly queer and generating extra cheers from the crowd. She left a footnote here in the musical book: “For the last eight years or so, whenever I perform it in concert, I sing ‘Meeting the man of my dreams / And then meeting his beautiful husband.’ Which is true. I have fallen in love with a lot of gay men.” I’m just obligated here, as a sidebar, to keep flagging instances of Alanis being an ally to my people.\nDiablo Cody knew she wanted to directly address the decades of controversy about “Ironic,” especially given that Alanis consistently has a playful attitude about the criticism. Cody writes that Alanis was “always open” to poking gentle fun at the song and “there is such a discourse around the inaccuracy of that song.” The use of “inaccuracy” here is telling, as if a rhetorical device could be objectively correct or not. She set the debate in an English class because it absolutely does belong there. “I would not have taken that meta approach unless I had felt that the song demanded it,” she wrote. Rather than make fun of the song, Cody forthrightly admits she wanted to “make fun of the song’s critics.”\nCelia Rose Gooding relates to the way criticism is deployed against her character, to shut her up in a grand sense just as critics tried to quiet Alanis. “People don’t like it when women speak their truth,” Gooding says in the musical book. “When you can find a little piece of something almost fractionally incorrect, it’s so easy to just say, ‘You’re wrong. You’re stupid. You don’t know what you’re talking about, girl.’” There’s the feminist seedling. We’ve covered why the broader French mode of irony that makes space for “Ironic” is superior to the Greek mode that excludes it, but we have not yet tied the irony issue to a larger conversation about sexism in the dismissal of Alanis’ work.\nFor this, we turn to the work of Lauren Berlant. Berlant was one of the most influential 21st century American cultural critics, known for pioneering the field of affect studies. Though they didn’t build upon Jung directly, their examination of how emotions are socially constructed is well aligned with Jung’s notion of how archetypes format human experience. Berlant theorizes that women’s feelings are simultaneously expressed and constrained by sentimentality. The portrayal of intense emotional states tied to women’s experiences is certainly a main mission of Alanis’ body of work and could also be considered a Jungian archetype. \"Jagged Little Pill\" is exemplary of the psychological landscaping Berlant is interested in as a cultural expression operating at the intersection of emotion, gender and power in public life. To silo or deride the mission of Alanis is to file it away as “female complaint.”\nIn Berlant’s view, irony is a key mode of expression in contemporary life because it showcases the gap between our ideals and the reality of our lived experience. It’s like meeting the man of your dreams and then meeting his beautiful husband. Irony produces laughs and shrugs that help us navigate the emotional and political contradictions of everyday life. Because women are often marginalized or excluded from dominant cultural narratives, irony provides us a means to subvert them and a pressure-release valve for our ambivalence about whether transformative social change is possible. “Ironic” shows how our expectations are consistently defeated by life, yet we do get psyched when we sing it. Berlant coined the term “juxtapolitical” to describe this messy, contradictory tangle of social and emotional interconnectedness that reveals itself as we grapple with our multidimensional context, using archetypes like the bummer situations presented in the lyrics of “Ironic.”\nOn top of this endorsement of irony, Berlant also theorized a post-irony characterized by meaningful sincerity, allowing us to patch or bridge the affective conflicts of public life that can’t be resolved through ironic detachment. They were a “both and” kind of theorist, just as Alanis is. Berlant thought that marginalized groups can’t afford the cruel optimism of attaching to unattainable happily-ever-after narratives, even if these American dream fantasies continue to shape culture. Between Barthes and Berlant, Alanis gets to have the black fly in her chardonnay and drink it, too. The worst-case scenario for “Ironic” here turns out to be not that bad at all. Alanis was both behind her times and ahead of them: behind in the sense that she may have botched one interpretation of irony, but ahead in the sense that her sincerity and authenticity were harbingers of a post-ironic future. In oscillating between expressing radical emotional honesty and playing with failure in her utilization of irony, she served up a prophetic glimpse of what ultimately became the standard milieu of young people at the crossroads between irony-obsessed Millennials and sincerity-possessed Gen Zers.\nHere’s a quick example of how young people still get Alanis while critical oldsters fail to learn any new tricks. In 2005, a decade after \"Jagged Little Pill,\" the Black Eyed Peas released a song called “My Humps,” which Alanis subsequently covered ironically. She was offering a critique, a feminist rejection of the supposedly postfeminist objectification of Fergie’s hot body. The video Alanis made for it shows her elbowing a handsy dude in the face. She also slowed the tempo way down to give it a less danceable ballad vibe. Her cover went massively viral and young people briefly allowed it to rule the internet because they totally understood the “both and” of it, while those with some journalistic power often did not. Of the fact that it is still normal for Alanis to be criticized in this way, all I can say is, it figures. Some descriptions of the “My Humps” cover from male critics: not funny, smug, witless, self-conscious, pop music cannibalism, dreadful and completely missing the point. Personally — and ironically — I’m more comfortable assigning those descriptions to her critics.",

    "title": "\"Lightning in a bottle\": How Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's love story inspired a Hallmark movie",
    "author": "Nardos Haile",
    "date": "November 30, 2",
    "text": "The world has been entranced with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship ever since she was seen sitting in a box seat at the Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri last year to watch him play football.\nThe rest is history. The pop star and Chiefs' tight end gallivanted around the world together, and Kelce ended up joining his girlfriend on stage performing at the London Eras Tour date earlier this summer. Their love has even inspired the Hallmark Christmas movie, \"Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story.\" In the movie, Alana (Hunter King) is the third generation in a family of Chiefs superfans, who believe that a special knit hat they own has the power to get the team to the Super Bowl. In turn, they're convinced that the Chiefs have also brought them love. As they family is in the running to win the Fan of the Year contest, Alana falls in love with Derrick (Tyler Hynes), a man who works for the Chiefs and helps determine the winner of the competition.\n\nI spoke to the stars of \"Holiday Touchdown\" at New York's Park Lane Hotel, which was already decorated for Christmas. During our interview, King and Hynes raved about how people like Swift and teams like the Chiefs bring such unity and togetherness.\n\"When I went to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, I just would look around and see everybody experiencing the same thing at the same moment, and everyone was impacted emotionally in a different way,\" said King about attending the tour in Missouri.\nLike Taylor Swift, \"Holiday Touchdown\" shows how the Chiefs, the spirit of Christmas and a little healthy competition can bring people together. Travis' own mother Donna Kelce even shows up to make a cameo in the film. Oh, and a Chiefs superfan who happens to be a cat also joins in on the fun.\nCheck out Salon's interview with the stars, who discuss their current Swift era and what it was like meeting Donna Kelce . . . and the scene stealer known as Catrick Mahomes.\nThe following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nWhile this story isn’t about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, their romance was likely an inspiration for it. What can you say about the impact of that couple becoming such a cultural phenomenon?\nTyler Hynes: It feels like everybody's rooting for them. That's such a lovely thing, when you have such a universal thing that people are getting behind. There are rare moments like that it seems as of late. [To] have everybody be rooting for them. It feels like a similar feeling, if you're talking about inspiration to the movie. It's kind of what's happening in the movie. Everybody's rooting for her character to get what she wants, to find love, and to really find and reaffirm her faith in this team and this tradition and family and all those wonderful things. While it's not a Taylor and Travis' story, there's obviously an inspiration from their love, as so many other things are.\nHunter King: It truly does feel like everyone is rooting for them. You feel that in this film as well, whether it's everyone collectively rooting for the Chiefs, rooting for us, rooting for Alana – you definitely feel that kind of love. I think that the Chiefs have bottled up that love that they have for each other, and it's just like lightning in a bottle, and everyone wants a little piece of it, wants to learn from it.\nHynes: When you see their huddles, like pregame stuff it just hypes you up, and you're just like, \"Yeah, that's a real family.\"\nAlana’s family is closely associated with the Kansas City Chiefs, to the point that there’s even a legend associated with the team and their relationships. Are there any stories that each of your families have handed down that have taken on a life of their own?\nHynes: There's a thing in Nova Scotia, Canada, where my grandparents are from, and it's a food item. It's called rappie pie, and it looks like prison food. It looks pretty unpleasant. Maybe prison food is delicious. I've never been in person, so what can I say? Doesn't look good. It looks like somebody ate the food and then gave it back to the plate, and then you're eating it again.\nBut it's like mashed potatoes with the starch that has been taken out. So it's like a clear jelly, and it's chicken, and you put butter and salt and pepper, and it's incredible. There isn't a person in the world who doesn't eat this thing. It's just like, \"Oh my god, this is delicious.\" The most comfort food. They've passed that on. Nobody knows what rappie pie is, except for maybe a small population. My parents have brought that into our lives. Every Christmas, people fight over it, not friendly. They love it.\nKing: My favorite thing is when my grandma gets a little bit tipsy, and then she'll share family secrets with me from way back in the day when she was a kid or about her grandparents. I'm gonna hold those near and dear to my heart, and she's sworn me to secrecy. But it is the best when she gets a little drunk. Tell me all the gossip.\nHynes: Naughty inside!\nKing: Oh yeah! *mimicking her grandma's voice* This person got in trouble! Never believe Uncle Timmy, like all that. Now I just know so much. I don't know half the people but I know what they did.\nChristine Ebersole, Ed Begley Jr., Diedrich Bader, Megyn Price, Hunter King and Tyler Hynes in \"Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story\" (Hallmark Media/Matt Hoover)What can you say about the importance that sports can play when it comes to fandom and how they identify with a team? Do either of you feel that way about any sport or team?\nKing: I think it just brings people together and to experience something collectively as a whole. I know right now we're talking about sports, but even when I went to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. I just would look around and see everybody experiencing the same thing at the same moment, and everyone was impacted emotionally in a different way. It just brought me to tears thinking how everyone was different in this moment and experiencing such joy altogether. That's what sports do for a lot of people, is they just bring everybody from different walks of life together to root for one thing, and people that maybe you would not have met before, and it's just such a special thing and such a bonding experience. People get to do [it] with your friends and your family. It creates a lot of tradition.\nHynes: I keep watching sports documentaries lately. I've been going on a run like I watched the Boston Red Sox beat the [Curse of the Bambino]. I get emotional watching these sports documentaries I'm finding. It's this underdog putting it all on the line, and just everything culminating to a moment and how precise and precious or fleeting that thing is. It's a really interesting thing that our culture, just being witness to, finds that same feeling that they feel doing it. That's a really fascinating, connective thing that our culture all engages in.\nIt's crazy that we have as much sports as we do. We have so many different facets of it. A lot of them are so elaborate. They're constantly evolving. It's fascinating. Now finding football for myself and looking into it more closely, how it all works and this team, it's a well that keeps filling. Even if it's an enemy on a different team, there's still a camaraderie there. Like our writer Julie Sherman Wolfe is a 49ers fan. Despite the fact that she hates my guts, doesn't mean we don't love each other.\nAnother large part of this movie is superstitions. Superstitions are incredibly important in sports, not just with Alana’s family. What sort of superstitions do you have, if any?\nKing: I don't have a sports superstition. Although during these interviews, I realized I maybe should adopt [one], but we are working like a collaborative superstition as a team, team being me and Tyler. But mine is just simple: if I see the clock and it says 11:11, and I don't make a wish, I'm just scared of what's to come like the universe will punish me. So I have to make a wish at 11:11 if I see it.\nHynes: She takes it to a dark place. It's supposed to be a positive right?\nKing: Well it is a superstition! I want something amazing to happen or even neutral. But you just can't miss it.\nHynes: I've never been like a superstitious person. I'm a skateboarder. We risk our body parts when we do certain things.You know what? I may have just discovered my only superstition. When I'm skateboarding, whenever I would start thinking of the worst case scenario like if there's a rail going downstairs, like, \"Oh, if I don't do that, then I'm gonna end up there, and my children will never be born.\" Those kinds of things. Yeah, I would go, \"I have to do it now.\" I would force myself to do it.\nKing: That's kind of a good superstition.\nHynes: It was like if I didn't do it, then you would never do it. There would be repercussions of some kind, so I'll force myself. That has become a superstition.\nRichard Riehle, Christine Ebersole, KC Wolf and Donna Kelce in \"Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story\" (Hallmark Media/Joshua Haines)\nTying this back to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, his mother Donna Kelce also makes a cameo in the movie. What was it like on set when she was there? She also appears this season on the other Hallmark movie “Christmas on Call.”\nHynes: We don't talk about that Christmas movie!\nKing: She was very popular. It was like being with the cool girl at school. Everyone wanted to talk to her. Everyone wanted to see her, see what she was wearing and see what she was doing. But then it's as if the cool girl was also the nicest person you've ever met, which makes it even better. So she was the popular cool girl – popular, cool, nice girl on set, and we couldn't get enough of her.\nHynes: It's true.\nKing: We love Donna.\nOf course, there were Chiefs stars there, including players Trey Smith and Trent Green, and Chiefs coach Andy Reid, not to mention the KC Wolf (with the googly eyes). What was it like working with each and experiencing the love of football with them too?\nHynes: [Trent] was like a legend of a man and he was so personable and was a good actor. Handsome, might I say! It was a unique experience having them all there. It was really wholesome. Everybody had such fun doing it. It didn't seem like people were getting nervous about things. Certainly, watching me perform makes everybody feel comforted knowing that the bar is down there.\nKing: Oh, stop it.\nHynes: Trent — remember how funny he was?\nKing: Yeah, he was phenomenal. It was the whole thing. He was great. Everyone was great. Everyone lived up to the expectations and more. It seemed like they had all done it many, many times before.\nHynes: Trey had his lines like an hour before he was acting.\nKing: He was off-book, ready to go!\nCatrick Mahomes and Hunter King in \"Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story\" (Hallmark Media/Joshua Haines)This is a question from my editor: What was it like to have a cat that dressed like Catrick Mahomes on set? Did you take a selfie with him?\nKing: Oh yeah.\nHynes: There were tons, too many selfies.\nKing: I love that cat. He was so huge. He was so chill.\nHynes: Aloof.\nKing: He was very, very cute, and he was just so chili, just out there the whole time. I think he got up once, and everyone's like, \"Oh wait, where's he going?\" He's the real star of the show.\nHynes: He covered a lot of ground too. There was a large surface area that he took up!\nHe's pretty big?\nHynes: Big boy!\nKing: Do you remember how much he weighs?\nHynes: No! It was a lot.\nDid y'all lift him?\nHynes: There was a moment I tried to lift him . . . Catrick, lay off the Häagen-Dazs.\nAre either of you Swifties? I know Hunter you mentioned Era's Tour. What date did you go to?\nKing: I went to the Kansas City Tour. My sister [actress Joey King] was in her music video and she got to come out on stage. They showed the music video, and [Joey] introduced her on stage. It was incredible. I've been a Swiftie for a very long time, but that was just, I've never been more proud in my life watching my sister up there in front of this crowd full of thousands of people like 60,000 at Arrowhead. Big Taylor Swift fan over here!\nTaylor Swift performs onstage for night one of Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on July 07, 2023 in Kansas City, Missouri (John Shearer/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management)\nWas that before or after you filmed this movie?\nKing: Before! A year and almost a day.\nDid it feel like crazy being back at Arrowhead Stadium?\nKing: Oh, yes, crazy. Then seeing it with an immense amount of her fans, and then when we got to film the scene where the drone shot pulls back, and it's just us in the stands. Seeing it completely empty was just wild. Then going later for the first opening day game, and then seeing it full of Chiefs fans. It was just seeing it in all different capacities was amazing.\nHynes: My [Swiftie] application is still pending. I wouldn't be so brave but I've watched a few documentaries as I do about everything. I love documentaries. There are three films I shot prior to shooting this movie. There's a young woman named Chloe who played my daughter in these films, and she is a huge Taylor Swift fan. I wore a Swiftie-style bracelet in the movie for her. She gave me a grocery list of songs I should listen to.\nThere's a few songs that I had already loved. I watched a documentary about her and I really started to understand. Again, it's wild because there are similarities between her, the Chiefs and Hallmark. There's an authenticity and an attention to detail that is shared by few. I understood why there is such a deep connection with this person who is turning out such an abundance of music and has such a legacy that she's leaving. It's this thoughtfulness that seems to be the connective tissue between Hallmark, Chiefs and Taylor. I saw that and watched the documentary . . . but I can't sing all the lyrics.\nKing: But you're in a \"Lavender Haze.\"\nIf you had to pick a Taylor Swift album that represents the era that you're in right now, what would it be?\nKing: I don't know! There's just too many. I love \"Midnights\" and \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\nHynes: Which one was the one that had \"Trouble\" on it?\nKing: \"Red.\" \"Red\" was a great album. \"1989\" was great. We could go on. I don't have a favorite. I love them all for different reasons.\nHynes: I got into \"Red\" and \"1989\" in Europe. I got in those discographies.\nKing: I have some more for you!\nWho are the bigger fans: football fans or Swifties?\nHynes: That's tough.\nKing: Oh, that's really tough. It might be a tie.\nHynes: You can't give it a tie. You got to draw a line in the sand. No one wants that. Viewers are going to be like, \"No!\" I'm gonna say Swifties.\nYou heard it here first!\nKing: International pop star!\nHynes: If you come for Taylor, they come for you! Somebody comes for football, you might walk away.\nKing: We protect our queen!\n\"Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story\" premieres Saturday, Nov. 30 at 8 p.m. ET on Hallmark Channel.",

    "title": "From “Mad Men” to “Sweethearts,” Kiernan Shipka says there's no such thing as \"just friends\"",
    "author": "Gabriella Ferrigine",

    "text": "Kiernan Shipka doesn’t like the phrase “just friends.” To the actress, who recently held roles in films like “Twisters,” “Longlegs” and “Red One,” it’s a trite reduction and frequent label applied to those relationships we can’t seem to define — the kinds that sit in the nebulous realm between friends and something more. The kinds that could almost certainly come to romantic fruition, if only someone could find the right words.\n“I always catch myself because it’s the way we say it, but I don’t like ‘just friends.’ I think you’re friends,” Shipka explained in a recent Salon Talks sit down. “It takes away from the fact that it’s really valuable.”\nIt’s a tension that sits at the heart of Shipka’s latest film, “Sweethearts,” a romantic comedy from HBO about Jamie (Shipka) and Ben (Nico Hiraga), two seemingly codependent best friends who make a pact to end each of their respective long-distance relationships from high school during the fall break of their freshman year at college. Aside from being drawn to the film’s comedic plotline and script, Shipka shared how she identified closely with the “will they won’t they” energy of Jamie and Ben’s friendship. “I definitely have a lot of ‘platonic friendships’ that have a tiny little dangling, ‘Is this just this or is this something more?’ It wasn’t something that I’d ever played before,” she added. “So that was another part of it that I thought, ‘Oh, that’ll be cool because I can really relate to that.”\nShipka also knows a thing or two about the nature of a long-lasting friendship like the ones seen in “Sweethearts.” One of her most well-known and longstanding friendships is with former “Mad Men” co-star January Jones, who played Shipka’s character’s mother, Betty Draper. “If you told little six-year-old me that, one day, we’d be getting drinks together and talking life, I think it would blow my mind,” Shipka says.\nThat’s the crux of where “Sweethearts” finds its true resonance with Shipka’s career. \"I love that I get to be a part of things where I then make friends and they stay my friends.”\nThe following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nCan you introduce us to the story? What about “Sweethearts” really drew you to it?\n“Sweethearts” is about a turkey dump [when a college student returns home for Thanksgiving and breaks up with their high school partner], which I did not know was a thing. It really revolves around this friendship between our main characters, Ben and Jamie, and they've been friends forever. They're sort of joined at the hip. They decided to go to college together, have never been romantic, and have their long-distance relationships that they decided to keep when they embarked on their college journeys.\nSlowly but surely, they start to realize that maybe these relationships are ruining their lives or at least their college experience. When they go home for Thanksgiving, they make a pact that they're both going to dump their significant others, and chaos ensues because it's a movie. [Laughter.]\nWas there anything in particular that made you really want to join this project?\nThere's so many things. First, I love comedy and I don't do it as often as I would like. That's always an immediate draw, but the script was so funny, it made me laugh. I just saw it with an audience for the first time, and everyone was laughing and it was so exciting. It's genuinely very funny, so that was one thing.\nEveryone involved was so great. That didn't change, from first impression to [now], we're all still friends and hanging out.\nAs far as the story itself, I definitely have a lot of \"platonic friendships\" that have a tiny little dangling \"is this just this or is it something more?\" It wasn't something I'd ever played before, so that was another part of it that I thought, \"Oh, that'll be cool because I can really relate to that.\"\nDo you think that long distance relationships can work?\nI think they can work, but I think it's hard when you're so young. Going to college, you're 18, 19, finding yourself. I think that's a hard time to have a long distance relationship. If it works for someone, that's amazing, but I totally understand where it's probably always hard. I feel like in my 20s, every single month I'm a new person and I am changing. If the person that I'm in a partnership with is far away, that's really tricky.\nSometimes embarking on adulthood or going away from home for the first time, that sense of, \"Oh, there's something from my past that's still with me,\" I see where that could be limiting for some people.\nAt one point in the movie, your character Jamie says she really only texts her boyfriend Simon when she's uncomfortable or looking for a distraction. How do you feel about the idea that people can get mired in this sense of familiarity, even if they aren’t in the best relationship?\nI feel like that can be applied to people. It can also be applied to things or the way that one lives their life. I think we all know what a comfort zone feels like and it's so understandable, but there's also so much on the other side of being comfortable. It's definitely a theme in the film that I could relate to, not so much so in a romantic relationship that I have or even really relationships with most of my friends, but just with things too.\nAccording to Ben, Jamie can be mean and has this desperate sense of wanting to be accepted. What do you think about her?\nShe has her trauma. She has a childhood experience with a group of girlfriends where she gets turned on and she doesn't really trust her female friendship, so she has none. Playing her, I viewed her as a wounded little girl in a lot of ways, and I think that externally came off as her being controlling.\nShe's so guarded. She is wall on wall on wall. There are some lines that didn't make it in the movie that were even more playing on that. For me, it's about kind of psychoanalyzing and getting into why exactly she's the way she is. She comes off one way, but inside, I think she's a ball of mush somewhere – you have to peel back the layers and the layers and the layers.\nPalmer (Caleb Hearon), Jamie's other close high school friend, has a subplot that was one of my favorite parts of the movie. He's clearly disenchanted by Cranford High and the drawbacks of being queer in the small town suburbs, but then he finds this unlikely camaraderie and comfort. Why is his character’s finding acceptance in unexpected places so important to the film?\nIt's so beautiful. It's really an amazing part of the movie, and it was really awesome to watch with an audience for the first time because I could tell that it really moved people. It moved me. I think it's great because a lot of kids are going to be watching this, a lot of kids who don't feel seen or like they can step into themselves fully without moving to New York, or moving to LA, or doing something drastic. You just see someone coming into their own as they are where they are. There's something really, really touching and special about that, and Caleb does such an amazing job.\nIt's also fun too. It's nice to have stuff that feels meaningful in a movie that's also really fun and silly. It's really lovely. It warmed my heart and it made me really proud to be a part of it.\nHow much would you say this movie is about individual exploration vs. being anti-relationship?\nI really do feel like it falls more on the individual exploration front and really, it’s about friendship too. At the end of the day, these relationships are driving the plot, but really what it's about is the fact that it's OK to change and grow. It's not some major threat if your friendship changes, it doesn't mean that it's over. That's what Jamie, in particular, but Ben and Jamie are learning through this movie.\nThe movie is certainly a lot about long-lasting friendships, and one of your most well-known friendships is with January Jones from your days on “Mad Men.” What does that friendship mean to you and how much of an influence does your time on Mad Men still have on your life?\nSo much. I still think this, but when I was six or seven, January Jones was the coolest living or dead human. Everything that she did, I then wanted to do. She would drink iced green tea, I wanted iced green tea. She wore UGGs like it was nobody's business, and I wanted UGGs. Truly, everything that she did, I was just bowing down. If you told little six-year-old me that, one day, we'd be getting drinks together and talking about life, I think it would blow my mind. I love her. I mean, she's still a great friend. It's been really cool to have once been a kid working with these people and now be an adult and have some cast members still in my life as friends. It's really nice, it's kind of “pinch me.\" There's something about it that doesn't quite feel real but [still is] very nice.\n“Sweethearts” is about moving on to the next stage of life. For someone who's been acting professionally for such a long time, does the film resonate with you moving on to the next chapter of your career or life?\nYeah, it completely does. On the front of just making the movie, I love that I get to be a part of things where I then make friends and they stay my friends. I actually cannot believe that this movie is coming out because we all just hang out all the time. I'm just talking about my friends right now and this experience that I had, I cannot believe that other people are going to see it. There's this nice thing as I get older where I'm like, \"Oh my God, I can make friends on the movies that I do?\" Because “Mad Men” was a different thing. I mean, everyone was so much older than me, and the kid who played my brother changed seven times, so that was hard to hold onto. Being a part of things that not only are really fun to work on because of the content, but also because of the people, is something that's become more of a priority as I've gotten older.\nIt's really a fun one, and I think making these moments feel like a big deal is great too. You can watch it and go, \"Oh, you're just going home and you're just breaking up with these people. It's just a flash in the pan of your life,\" but it's a big moment. I think it's a moment that changes both of them and will significantly for the rest of their lives. It's cool to zoom in on very particular moments in life. That's what I love about films in general.\nI also liked how much the film values friendship.\nI do too. [Some people are] just friends. Actually, I always catch myself because it's the way we say it, but I don't like “just friends.” I think you're friends. I always bump on that, and it's something my mom used to tell me a lot too when I was like, \"Oh, no. We're just friends.\" She goes, \"No, you're friends. That's enough. You're not just friends.\" I like that, but I catch myself all the time because obviously it's the way that it's said. It takes away from the fact that it's really valuable.\nA clip from “When Harry Met Sally” plays in the film. We hear Billy Crystal as Harry say that no man can be friends with a woman he finds attractive. Was “Sweethearts” grappling with that question something that interested you?\nYeah, I thought it was a really interesting thing to talk about in a movie. I certainly have tons of platonic friendships that I don't think are going anywhere, and they're great. I really did want to touch on that, because obviously, that's such a notion and it's such an iconic monologue. How can it not get in your head? I mean, it's profound in its way, and he's rooted in that belief. If you think that, you can totally move about the world that way, but I think there's another way and this movie has that message. I loved that, because it was relatable to me and I think a ton of people.\n\"Sweethearts\" premieres Nov. 28 on Max.\n",

    "title": "In \"Queer,\" Daniel Craig is blisteringly beautiful as he falls for love's devastating power",
    "author": "Coleman Spilde",
    "date": "November 27, 2",
    "text": "On paper, it may seem like director Luca Guadagnino’s two 2024 releases are entirely different. The colossal hit “Challengers” was a hard pivot from the Italian director’s typical style, teeming with a bold, pulsating sexiness far more overt than most of his other efforts. The film was also Guadagnino’s most accessible yet, capturing a sex-starved zeitgeist looking to latch on to something truly horny amid modern sex scene discourse. But after making a hard tilt toward the mainstream just seven months ago, Guadagnino’s latest film “Queer” pivots back toward his softer, narratively opaque roots. And though the two movies look like diametrical opposites, they share a pair of undeniable throughlines: the aching, all-consuming feeling of desire and the remarkable actors chosen to depict it.\n“Queer,” adapted from William S. Burroughs’ 1985 novella, dials down the sheer athletic intensity of its predecessor in Guadagnino’s filmography. Still, the salty scent of sweat and the weight of unspoken yearning lingers in the atmosphere, waiting for a wholly committed Daniel Craig to saunter into the frame in a white linen suit to pick up where “Challengers” left off. In “Queer,” Craig plays William Lee, an addict in 1950s Mexico City whose dependence on drugs and alcohol is as torturous as his penchant for gay sex — though he’s better at concealing the former than the latter. Like any functioning addict, Lee is one push from falling off the edge where he has so carefully perched himself. When he meets the strapping young army vet Eugene Allerton (Drew Starkey), Lee is thrust into free fall, stricken by compulsion and fixation unlike anything he’s experienced before.\nThough “Queer” could be seen as a thematic companion to Guadagnino’s 2017 film “Call Me By Your Name” — which was adapted from equally controversial source material — the movies are more alike in feeling than form. With “Queer,” Guadagnino and screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes take an abstract approach to fleshing out the intricacies of Burroughs’ work. Through protracted, surrealist drug trips, striking production design, and sex scenes that are as erotic as they are realistic, Guadagnino manages to adapt the otherwise unadaptable, challenging his actors as much as he does his audience. Those aspects of the film are formidable and will surely leave some viewers bewildered, if not irritated. But that’s precisely how the raw pain of love often feels, and “Queer” conveys that unique torment more exquisitely than any other film this year.\nFalling in love is, of course, frequently mortifying, and Lee is no stranger to embarrassing himself in front of his paramours. When he first spots Allerton strolling past a cock fight in the street, Lee is transfixed. (Surely, it’s no accident that this lust-at-first-sight moment happens at such an appropriately named event.) In the Ship Ahoy, one of the many local bars that Lee and his band of homosexual flâneurs frequent, Lee orders a shot of mezcal for courage before standing up to bow in Allerton’s direction. The advance is brushed off by its recipient, and Lee exits in a huff to pursue a lover elsewhere, ultimately bringing a young man (Omar Apollo) back to a motel where the stark red hallway walls reflect the passion that takes place behind them.\nOmar Apollo in \"Queer\" (A24)Guadagnino has proven himself a master of imparting a feeling without words, and “Queer” is no different. Any narrative-driven dialogue is relatively sparse. Instead, Guadagnino’s frequent cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom beautifully illustrates emotions through color and framing. The glow of the red motel walls, the neutral whites of Lee and Allerton’s impartial meeting place the Ship Ahoy, and later, the verdant green of the jungle all say what the characters so often cannot. Lee makes no secret of his homosexuality, but he knows this type of candid personality can be abrasive and unwelcome in his era, meaning that he must be reserved in the right moments. This allows Guadagino and Kuritzkes to frequently leave it up to the audience to infer what characters feel at any given time, while breathtaking miniature sets and dreamy, painted skies remind us that Lee is but a small piece of a big world, fighting to find meaning in his insignificance.\nLee uses heroin to escape the feeling of triviality, but when Allerton warms up to him, Lee’s focus shifts to a new drug: yagé. Lee is fascinated by the plant, specifically the rumblings he’s heard that it can be used for telepathy. At first, his mentions of yagé are fleeting, mere ways of making interesting conversation with a lover who only carries a passing interest in Lee. But despite Allerton rebuking any queerness in himself, Lee descends into an obsession with both the young man and yagé, convincing Allerton to accompany him on a trip to South America to find anyone who can administer the drug he believes will open the door between the two men.\nCraig is known for playing characters with a tough exterior, and in that way, “Queer” is a novel film for the seasoned actor. He’s never had a role quite like Lee, which allows him to approach the world with far less certitude than a James Bond or Benoit Blanc. Craig finds a blistering beauty in that ambiguity, reducing himself to a sniveling, lovestruck addict who wants nothing more than to understand why the person he’s falling for can’t open up in the same way Lee can. Starkey’s Allerton is just as lost as Lee, though far less forthright about it. As he moves Allerton between fascination and disinterest, Starkey — best known for being one of the leads in Netflix’s “Outer Banks” — matches Craig’s experienced aplomb and proves himself a stunning new talent.\nWhen “Queer” makes its way to its third act in the South American jungles, things take a turn for the bizarre. But it’s in that abnormality where the film finds its most moving passages, given just enough comic relief by an almost unrecognizable turn from Lesley Manville as a wacky scientist who happens to be the world’s top yagé researcher. The drug trip sequences are inevitable, and by the time we reach them, Guadagnino has already done so much to remind us of the suffering we endure when those we love are just out of reach. The ephemeral caress of a lover’s touch is stunningly depicted through literal translucence, giving “Queer” some of its most unforgettable images whose only competition is the yagé scenes. For a director who has spent his entire career portraying the splendor and sadness of love in equal measure, Guadagnino’s third act isn’t shocking so much as it is thoroughly touching.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n“Queer” demonstrates that there is no other working director who can so vividly recall love’s immense power. Guadagino adapts the unadaptable, turning out highly original, stylish films that draw equally resplendent performances from his actors, and his latest is no different, even if it is far more ambiguous. Prioritizing a feeling over narrative sense is a daring risk in contemporary cinema, but with “Queer,” Guadagnino asserts that it’s a worthwhile one. Here, he asks us to think back to our great loves — realized or unrequited — and warns us that the longing never goes away. Impossible beauty only becomes more intense with the knowledge that you may never know its full extent. All we have is a caress, a stare or a lingering touch. And sometimes, those things are so powerful that we’ll go to the end of the world just for the chance to understand someone a little better.\n\"Queer\" opens in New York and Los Angeles on Nov. 27 and nationwide on Dec. 13.",

    "title": "\"The Seed of the Sacred Fig\" explores the ideology of Iranian family members who \"submit to power\"",
    "author": "Gary M. Kramer",
    "date": "November 27, 20",
    "text": "Exiled Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof’s “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” is a powerful indictment of totalitarianism and the Iran regime. The film, which won both a Special Jury Prize and the FIPRSECI award at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, and is Germany’s Oscar submission for best international film, is a gripping and incendiary drama. It prompted Rasoulof, who was sentenced to eight years in prison, to escape Iran on foot. The film was made in secret, with post-production done remotely.\nThe filmmaker is no stranger to controversy. His outstanding 2020 film, “There Is No Evil” was an equally brilliant examination of the death penalty in Iran from four perspectives. It, too, was made in secret and, like all of Rasoulof’s films, banned in Iran.\nIn “The Seed of the Sacred Fig,” Iman (Missagh Zareh), who works in the justice system, gets promoted to an investigator for the State. This puts his family at risk, but his supportive wife Najmeh (Soheila Golestani) is pleased they will soon be able to move to a less cramped apartment. She informs their teenage daughters Rezvan (Mahsa Rostami) and Sana (Setareh Maleki) that they need to be careful not to post anything on social media or reveal the identity of their father as it could put their lives and safety in jeopardy.\nBut when Rezvan’s friend from college, Sadaf (Niousha Akhshi) becomes involved in the “Woman Life Freedom” protests in Tehran, it emboldens both daughters and forces Najmeh to keep a secret from her husband, who is sure to disapprove.\nAs tensions rise, things are further complicated when Iman’s gun goes missing and he suspects one of his family members of stealing it. His efforts to get to the bottom of who took his weapon culminate in a series of very intense episodes.\nIman represents Iran, as well as submission, faith and absolute obedience. In contrast, his daughters are emblematic of the changing world, and his wife is caught in the middle, protecting both her husband and daughters.\nWith the assistance of an interpreter, Iante Roach, Rasoulouf spoke with Salon about his remarkable and courageous film.\nThis film tackles issues about state control. Can you talk about your strategy as a filmmaker to provoke and question authority?\nFor me, the most important issue is the relationship between individuals and power and accepting responsibility and individual responsibility. This is something I think about all the time. I’m convinced that in a society where there is a high level of taking on personal responsibility it is harder, if not impossible, for totalitarianism to take root. On the other hand, there is also another concept, vis-à-vis, personal responsibility, which I tend to call [speaks Persian] which means “Handing your head over to someone else.” We could translate that as submission to power, to ideology. I try to tell stories about the relationship between individuals and power, and naturally, this leads to them having a political dimension.\n“The court is not your home,” one character says when Iman gets authoritative. He wants to “restore” his family which he feels is splintering apart. Can you talk about the issues of public and private? How laws are applied in society, but different rules are applied within a family?\nTotalitarian society is almost as if power and ideas are [configured] with the head at the top of the pyramid and projected downwards to member of society. In the film, there is a scene where Iman and his wife are praying. We see Iman praying and submitting to a higher power, in this case, a religious divinity, a god. Then we see his wife behind him, following him. He wants the same from his children. They should also follow him. It is as if the person who chooses to submit to power or an ideology wants others to submit to him or her. It is a chain of relations.\nThe film addresses protests against an authoritarian regime. Iman, the patriarch, becomes a microcosm for the macrocosm of Iranian society the film depicts.\nThe film was made outside of the realm of Iranian censorship in defiance of it. But I think the main issue goes beyond patriarchy. In this specific case, it is set within a totalitarian, religious, theocratic regime, as patriarchy is the particular shape the submission to power takes within this country because men are clearly, within that system, considered superior to women.\nThe Seed of the Sacred Fig (Neon)\nDid Iran specify what was objectionable about your film that was banned?\nYou would never be able to get permission to shoot such a film that posits these topics in Iran. It is more that they think the film in its entirety is wrong and should not exist.\nThe gun in the film is a symbol. It is faith. It is “the law,” and it is the “system.” It is the father. What can you say about the ideas of authority and safety and paranoia?\nThe film sets out as a family drama where the family dynamics and relationships are the most important thing, and it slowly unravels in a quite different direction. The weapon is a symbol of power, and what I wondered was if the figure who impersonates power thinks or is afraid that they will lose that power, how will they react? In such circumstances, my guess is that patriarchy tends to become repressive, and if we pay attention, that’s what happens in Iran with the regime. I think that these concepts eventually transcend the family and that allows us to see the family as representing society at large, rather than just one specific entity. And as we approach the end of the film, there is a new layer which is a historical gaze at the story of Iran and the story of the film within context of Iranian history.\nI appreciate that “The Seed of the Sacred Fig” asks viewers to put themselves in the position of the characters: Do you protest like Sadaf? Do you help someone like Rezvan? Do you turn a blind eye to the protests like Najmeh? Or do you punish like Iman? I kept shifting my perspective and aligned with each character at different times. What do you want viewers to glean from your film?\nI think it is important that you see the human facets of someone who collaborates with the regime and is a cog of the regime. A father loves his children and wants the best for them even if he collaborates with a highly repressive state. At the same time, Iman wants to choose what is best for his children in order to best protect them. If we look at the mother, she of course, to quite an extension in the film, is an active agent of patriarchy even though she is a woman. Because she thinks she can only achieve safety, even just for herself, by protecting the family. People who collaborate with regimes of this sort are not necessarily monsters. But what is scary about them is that they have given up their capacity for free thinking and they refer to an external authority. That’s why I insist on the fact that the main theme is submission to power or ideology.\nAll the characters lie, deceive or hide the truth. What observations do you have about this?\nThe question is: Why do they do that? The totalitarian systems always want you to hide your real self. The father hides many things because he is afraid of power and those above him. The mother hides many things because she is afraid of the father. The children do the same because they are afraid of both parents. And what is lost here is trust. And that is absolutely what a totalitarian system needs in order to hold on to power and continue its job. It is the way society becomes atomized, and people cannot come together to effect change. What is interesting here is how at this way of operating it penetrates down from top of a pillar to a nuclear family.  When the father is so convinced of the ideas and of the truth, that he has chosen to submit himself to that, there is no other reality in the world. I think in the end what will happen is that this mistrust or distrust will pervade the system itself and destroy it from within.\nTo give an example, one day, when I was in prison in 2022, at the height of the “Woman Life Freedom” movement, I was walking along a corridor and a prison guard took me by the arm and took me into another corridor, where we would not be filmed by the closed circuit cameras, and he asked me, “What do you think is going to happen?” I told him, “Well, actually, you are the person who can go out of here and see what is happening with all these protests. Perhaps you should be the one who tells me.” And the guard says, “If things get really bad and there is a regime change, would you be ready to say we treated you here very well?” And that is really the way this family [in the film] is impacted. The deep rift that takes place within it is a consequence of external events.\nThe Seed of the Sacred Fig (Neon)\nIt is the metaphor of the seed of the sacred fig of the title, which corrupts and takes over. It is the symbol of a tree killing its host to survive. Can you talk about this metaphor for Iran?\nAbsolutely, but then again, I am convinced that the beauty of this metaphor as a title is that you can look at it from the perspective of each different character and draw a different conclusion, or see a different story being told by the title. If we look at the tree’s life cycle from the viewpoint of the daughters, what is beautiful and interesting is the hope that these new shoots represent. Whereas if we take on the father’s perspective maybe what would interest us are the unethical aspects of the tree story. I love playing with titles where you can read different meanings.\n“The Seed of the Sacred Fig” is a very intimate and claustrophobic, especially the first half set in the family’s home. Can you talk about shooting close-ups of an injured face, or the detail of Najmeh shaving Iman?\nI was very keen to get across how this man, Iman, has turned his own home into a prison — a prison within which life is still present, and still happening. The scene in which Najmeh is removing the fragments of the bullet from Sadaf’s face reminds us of the humanity that is present in all these characters. Because in the end it is a decision the mother takes to ignore what she sees in order to protect her husband’s job and what she perceives as the family’s safety and security. When she is shaving her husband’s face and taking intimate physical care of him, it is her way of helping him achieve his aims and dreams. In that scene, we hear a piece of music that refers to an Iranian poem which reminds us how in Iranian culture, even love is something where you have to submit. And that is what I really like to investigate — does that mean this submission to power has deep cultural roots and is that where it comes from and is that why it is allowed to continue? Or is it the other way around — is this culture and literature a result of a millennia of tyranny that has seeped into the culture?\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nThe film is getting considerable Oscar buzz. What would it mean for you if this film gets shortlisted or even wins the Oscar?\nWell, I’m totally stunned. I never thought about the Academy Awards ever in my professional life. I saw a submission from Iran as the only way to have access to the Academy. Of course, all of my films are banned, so there is no way they will ever send them to the Academy. The way this film was made was quite different, and in the end, it led to Germany choosing to submit it as best international feature film. This has a great deal of significance for me. It feels to me as if whoever made this choice in Germany decided to have their people become the spokespersons for my people, for another people. I think this shows that the human aspect of cinema is stronger than its tribal one.\nFinally, if it is not prying, can you talk about living in exile?\nIt’s very early days. I’ve been so busy and have been travelling non-stop that I have yet to get to that moment when I may feel I have some control over my time and can start thinking about this. I don’t know when that moment will come.\n“The Seed of the Sacred Fig” opens Nov. 27 in select theaters with national expansion to follow.",

    "author": "Gary M. Kramer",
    "date": "November 26, 2",
    "text": "The cogent documentary, “Surveilled,” now available on HBO, tracks journalist Ronan Farrow as he investigates the proliferation and implementation of spyware, specifically, Pegasus, which was created by the Israeli company NSO Group. The company sells its product to clients who use it to fight crime and terrorism. It is claimed that Pegasus was instrumental in helping capture Mexican drug lord, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzman. However, there are also reports that NSO’s products are being used to target journalists, human rights activists and political dissidents.\nDirectors Matthew O’Neill and Perri Peltz follow Farrow as he meets with individuals including a former NSO employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity; Ron Deibert, of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which uncovered spyware abuse; and Elies Campo, in Catalonia, Spain, who is able to check phones for spyware. Campo discovers that members of the European parliament have been hacked in part because Catalonia has angered Madrid by wanting to become independent. He also found out his own parents and sister were targeted, which emphasizes the concerns and implications of this nefarious spyware.\nFarrow explores how the United States is testing and evaluating Pegasus and other spyware as well as whether to ban or regulate it.\nSalon spoke with Farrow, along with filmmakers Matthew O’Neill and Perri Peltz about “Surveilled” and spyware.\nHow did you learn about Pegasus and what made you spend two-plus years investigating spyware in general and Pegasus and NSO in particular?\nRonan Farrow: It flowed from reporting I’d done in the Israel private intelligent space around the story “Harvey Weinstein’s Army of Spies.” I and other people were being followed around and intimated by a firm called Black Cube. Through that body of reporting and the book “Catch and Kill,” about that espionage plot, I became fascinated by the way in which surveillance issues are not incidental to any of the other issues I report upon, whether that is abuse of power in the corporate sector or national security issues. Surveillance underpins all of it. The questions of fairness and accountability is so often shaped by whether people in power are surveilling their opponents. I wanted to unmask that industry. It is not that I don’t think there is a place for it to exist, but people need to understand how much watching people who are less powerful in a democracy can shrink the space for democratic expression.\nThrough those relationships, I understood that what I have been exposed to — old-fashioned gumshoes and some light tech surveillance. I also came to understand that as much as that shrank that space of my reporting, it wasn’t the outer edge. The consequential part of it was this incredibly advanced technology you see documented in the film. Pegasus can turn on your phone freely, it can capture all your calls, photos and videos, and disgorge every text and email you sent. I was fascinated by the capacity of tech accelerating and how available and how prevalent it was becoming.\nMatthew and Perri, how did you get involved in making this film, and what decisions did you make in how to tell or approach the story?\nMatthew O’Neill: This topic chose us. The executives at HBO, Lisa Heller and Nancy Abraham, connected Perri and me to Ronan to have a conversation broadly about what he was working on, and what we were working on. Together, we created the “Axios” on HBO series, which used the intersection of documentary techniques fused with television journalism.\nPerri Peltz: We really looked at this as an opportunity to go behind the scenes in the journalism. So much of it was based originally on Ronan’s reporting for The New Yorker. Having the opportunity to follow Ronan as he investigated this story is incredibly compelling. This is not a talking heads film, it’s watching Ronan do what he does so well, and we thought capturing that on film would translate well for the audience.\nO’Neill: The idea was that the audience would feel like they are going on journey of discovery with Ronan, like riding shotgun in his investigation. We were lucky to have Ronan’s voice, but also seeing the detritus of Ronan’s all-nighter eating at his desk at The New Yorker, when he’s rushing for the deadline, gives a behind-the-scenes look at what print journalists do. The work is really time consuming, and difficult, and challenging. You get a taste of that.\nIn the film, you uncover that NSO has been selling Pegasus to Europe for one price and the Middle East for 25 times that price as well as to African countries. Is this simply a “follow the money” story? Does this all come down to a question of supply and demand?\nFarrow: That’s certainly part of it. It calls into question the dog-and-pony show you get from some of these leading spyware companies who say our business is about empowering benign democracies. Employees [in these companies] quit over ethical concerns saying no, the bread and butter is in the cases where the company knows or should know that there are going to be abuses. That is an intractable problem for this industry. It is a weapon of sorts. Lawyers at NSO make this point on camera in the film — this is a form of arms dealing. We’re selling weapons to the world, and it is not our fault that there is no Geneva Convention equivalent to put guardrails or consequences that are sufficient. Yes, it is a \"follow the money\" story about who is using and making this technology. To be clear, the NSO group is just one example in this multibillion-dollar industry. It’s everywhere now.\nO’Neill: We hope that the balance between the supply and the demand is clear. In terms of law enforcement, and you also hear it from [Congressman] Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee saying, “If this is software that can help rescue my theoretically kidnapped child, I want that.” It’s part of the real challenge in terms of abuse and potential use of this software. What is a crime and what is being investigated as a crime? What you see unfold in Catalonia is people who are representatives of civil society advocating for certain political situations. They are seen by representatives of the state as legitimate targets of investigation. It is easy when it is a clear terrorist or someone who kidnapped a child to say their phone should be hacked, but when these tools are all powerful because it’s geolocation, pictures and medical records, that’s a whole new territory.\nFarrow: It is such an under-regulated space. The stories captured in the film include Elies and his family finding out in real time that they have been hacked and all of the consequences of that. They are innocent, apolitical bystanders. I hope that people see those stories and understand it is not just information gathering; it really can intimidate and be so painful personally. But also, it shrinks the space for free expression and efforts to holding people accountable. It can come for any one of us.\nPeltz: We know that people are using Pegasus to target dissidents, activists and politicians, but there is residual and collateral damage as well. There is something about this ability to say, “It’s not going to happen to me. I’m an open book. I’m not doing anything wrong, so therefore there is nothing to be afraid of.” And that’s wrong. We both learned you don’t have to be a politician, or an activist, or a dissident. You see this in Elies’ mother, a physician, and all the images of her patients that get exposed as a result of Pegasus. If you think, I haven’t done anything wrong, why does it matter? It does matter, and all of us need to worry about what the potential impact is. You never know [spyware] was there. It copies everything on your phone and it leaves. That’s really bad. It’s your bank and health records, your photos, your family.\nSurveilled (HBO)\nIt is exponentially terrifying. Do you worry that your phones, or your family member’s phones, would be hacked because you were investigating this topic? Did you have Elies test your phone?\nFarrow: Yeah, I am really in a situation now where no one is going to want to hang out with me, dammit! [Laughs] Of course, I worry about this all the time, and try to exercise good digital hygiene, and use devices as secure as possible and test those devices regularly.  But to do the work I do is to acknowledge it is all porous and you have to work as hard as you can to protect yourself and your sources. But these days, ultimately, if someone wants to put the effort and money into hacking you, they can. It can happen.\nPeltz:  Absolutely. Elies did test our phones. We were aware that it was a possibility, So far, so good, but we absolutely had our phones checked and it would be foolhardy if we didn’t.\nLikewise, I fear we should be very concerned that with this incoming administration spyware is going to be unregulated in the United States, and there will be consequences. What observations do you have about spyware’s immediate future?\nFarrow:  I put up a piece in The New Yorker this week. It was fascinating to talk to experts in the privacy law space who are really in a high state of alarm right now. The United States, under administrations from both parties, has flirted with this technology in ways that is alarming. Under the first Trump administration, they bought Pegasus. They claimed they were buying it to test it and see what our enemies were doing, and The New York Times later sued them for more information and found really persuasive evidence that the FBI wanted to operationalize that in American law enforcement investigations.\nIn this latest piece I talk about ICE and the Department of Homeland Security purchasing spyware tech from a company called Paragon, and that contract is currently under review, and we don’t know if that will be unraveled, or what restraints will be put on that. The thing I hear from these privacy law experts is the DHS is where you see the purchasing of legally dubious technology because they have a built-in excuse, “Hey, it’s all in the course of law enforcement operations.” There is very little reason to think that we are going to see more aggressive self-policing under this incoming Trump administration than we did under the Biden administration. And under Biden it was insufficient. They promised to pass an executive order, and they did, ostensibly limiting how much of this spyware the government can purchase. But we are already seeing how many loopholes there are to that. You can imagine how you couple the Trump administration’s various promises that are so much about targeting the opposition, enemies and vulnerable groups – and statements that show a flagrant disregard for law – you can image how experts fighting in this space to safeguard privacy rights are really worried right now.\nO’Neill: It’s Sinclair Lewis — “It can’t happen here.” We look around the world and think this is going to happen in China and in Russia, and other places. If there is something that changed for us over the course of film, it was understanding this can happen in democracies, and with U.S. allies. It can certainly happen here. It is just a matter of decision-making of the people in charge.\nPeltz: This is not going away. We are not putting this genie back in the bottle. It’s just a question of understanding how best to regulate its use.\nIs there an appropriate use for spyware?\nFarrow: This is not a new part of the story of government excess or breeches of privacy. There is always this debate that there are legitimate law enforcement reasons, certainly theoretically, where we can reach for cases where that’s how it played out, or instrumental in exposing criminal plots and tracking down criminals. There is a reason why law enforcement officials love the idea of being about to do that without any guardrails on it. They want to be able to open up any phone at any time. In democracies with checks and balances in them, we tend to restrain that because it is a fundamental truth that is going to be abused. If companies only promise to sell it to governments who police the use of this, we only see abuses in conventionally repressive settings, like Saudi Arabi, and Jamal Khashoggi getting killed. Technology allegedly was on phones around him.\nNow this history we are reporting on in this film is much more about realizing it is happening everywhere. Having a constitution that protects privacy rights, and having a set of rules and regulations that should be followed isn’t enough. That’s how you see these scandals playing out in Greece and Spain, as you see in the film, and Poland. It’s the same pattern. The government says they are using it for law enforcement purposes, and then there is this overreach, and suddenly it is on the phones of political opposition members, activists and journalists.\nAny problems we have in this country, where we want people to be able to expose facts related to the problem, or we want people to freely express dissent to the government is affected by the proliferation of this relatively cheap, increasingly easy to use, increasingly intrusive spyware. The less space there is for privacy for those kinds of conversations, the more the powerful can keep things under their thumbs. That is something we should all be worried and thinking about. It is not specific to United States or any one political party, it is just a fundamental truth.\nO’Neill: Ultimately, it’s about the rule of law and the system of checks and balances that exist for the use of any surveillance technology including this incredibly powerful one. That is our best hope for responsible use by governments and by our own government. As consumers, we can keep the pressure on providers of all the apps we use, the browsers, the operating systems saying, “We want privacy. Privacy is driving our decisions on what we use.” If we keep pressure on the technology companies, that privacy matters to us and they will keep up in the cat-and-mouse game of hackers and commercial spyware providers.\nPeltz: This is a Gordian knot of a problem. This doesn’t go away entirely unless our cell phones go away entirely.  What are the chances of that? Pretty close to zero. This is a problem that will be with us as long as we are in a connected world. We just have to figure it out and grapple with it.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nWhat are our options here?\nFarrow: I do think people can and should vote according to these kinds of civil liberties concerns and look for political candidates, on whatever side of the aisle, who are going to protect our privacy rights and our basic freedoms. If you care about this, you should call and write to representatives in Congress that this is a concern, and we need legislation that puts guardrails on this. We need people on the Hill to hold whoever is in the White House to account on this and make sure there is greater transparency about what government offices are purchasing commercial spyware, what the vetting process is, what the red lines are when it can be used.\nI criticize the Biden administration heavily on this and I sat down with a Biden administration official and asked, “Why are you not being transparent about the loopholes here?” The executive branch of the government is never automatically going to self-police. They are going to want the loopholes. Maybe sometimes for an understandable law enforcement reason, but it should be our job as a body politic to press people in Congress to force rule-making and accountability. Otherwise, you see in one democracy after another where innocent peaceful protesters and political opposition members are being targeted, and journalism and the flow of information is threatened.\nPeltz: Unless you give up that connected life, you are going to be dealing with these issues at some level. What is second best, is figuring out how to regulate it. It is here to stay to some extent.\nO’Neill: The only simple concrete advice we received was reboot your phone every day. Pegasus software is designed to erase itself, so if you reboot your phone, you are not vulnerable if it infected you yesterday.\nPeltz: I don’t want to be a downer, but I’m going to add to that: Sometimes.\n“Surveilled” is now available on HBO.",

    "author": "Kim Porter",

    "text": "Homeowners are reluctant to sell right now, and for good reason. On the one hand, taking advantage of the steep increase in home values—which are up by 47% from 2020—means you can net a sweet profit when you sell. But it also means dealing with expensive interest rates and high home prices if you need to buy a new property.\nMy husband and I found ourselves in this scenario in 2024. Selling our condo would provide enough money to make a 20% down payment on a larger single-family house, but we were pretty nervous about our prospects in the new housing market.\nWe decided to take the plunge, and our mortgage payment more than doubled in the process, going from $2,150 to $4,650. We can afford the larger payment and we’re happy we gained more privacy, more space and the freedom to customize our property.\nBut it’s always important to plan for budget changes and even save money when possible. So before taking on the mortgage, my husband and I mapped out several ways to deal with the larger payments and save on interest costs. We also learned about other strategies that we’re not using at the moment, but other homeowners could look into. Here’s what we found out, starting with the easiest approach.\nThis strategy is one of the easiest ways to save on interest costs and pay off your home loan ahead of schedule. It involves splitting your monthly mortgage payment in half, then making that payment every two weeks instead of sending the full payment once a month.\nYou’ll end up making 13 full payments over the course of the year instead of 12. And when you make more frequent payments toward the loan, interest compounds on a smaller principal balance. You also build equity faster.\nSetting up biweekly payments was quick and easy for us. I made a 10-minute phone call to our loan servicer, signed and submitted a form, and paid a one-time $75 fee. If we stick to the biweekly payment schedule for the entire loan term, we’ll save $144,080.38 in interest and will pay off the loan about four and a half years early.\nWe were lucky enough to close on our first mortgage with a 2.75% interest rate. But since rates have shot up in the last few years, we had to accept 6.49% this time around. So we plan to refinance as soon as rates settle—which could happen in the near future.\nIn its October 2024 Economic and Housing Market Outlook, the National Association of Realtors predicts the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will fall to 5.8% by the end of next year.\nOf course, “There is no guarantee that rates will go down,” said Jennifer Beeston, a branch manager and SVP of mortgage lending at Guaranteed Rate Mortgage. With this unknown variable, Beeston said we should make sure we can afford the monthly payment with the current rate. (We can.)\nWe’re also planning to potentially use our current mortgage originator in the refinance, which is waiving closing costs on a new loan. However, Beeston cautions, lenders that offer no-closing-cost refinances usually increase your interest rate to recoup their costs.\nSo we plan to get quotes from multiple lenders and negotiate when it’s time to refinance. But we’re also keeping in mind that a no-closing-cost refinance can still put us ahead as long as we’re lowering our current rate.\nRenting out a room or any space on your property can be a great way to offset a portion of your monthly mortgage payment. This strategy, known as house hacking, “has become all the rage,” said Nicole Rueth, a branch manager and SVP at Movement Mortgage.\nWe see this as a good long-term plan, since our new house comes with a completely renovated basement and our town is a desirable location with loads of amenities. We plan to direct the rent money—around $1,500 per month—as an extra payment toward the mortgage loan principal. If we faithfully make the extra payment, it should save us $436,575 in total interest and shave 15 years off the repayment term.\nIf you’re thinking about leveraging your own property somehow, Rueth suggests researching rental prices in your area and understanding the tax implications at your tax bracket. It’s also important to “make sure you’re comfortable sharing spaces and have a clear agreement in place to avoid any misunderstandings,” she said.\nA rate buydown allows you to temporarily lower the interest rate on your mortgage in exchange for making an upfront deposit. The goal is to help you ease into your mortgage payments, especially during periods of high interest rates.\nFor instance, if you get a “2-1 buydown,” the interest rate is lowered by 2 percentage points in the first year and 1 percentage point in the second year. The rate then rises to the regular, permanent rate in the third year.\nThe deposit you make for the buydown can be pretty expensive. A 2-1 buydown on a $500,000 home with a 6.5% permanent rate, for example, would cost about $9,100 upfront. Your loan servicer keeps the deposit in a bank account and withdraws money each month to subsidize your mortgage payment.\nWhile you temporarily reduce your payments, this strategy only saves you money if someone else (like your lender or the seller) covers the upfront deposit.\n“Otherwise, you’re actually better off paying a higher interest rate and keeping your money in the bank,” said Melissa Cohn, the regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage. “Then dribble out money from your savings to help you carry the larger payment in the beginning.”\nWith our home loan, no one paid for a rate buydown on our behalf, so the savings won’t apply to our situation. But you can keep this option in mind for yourself.\nRecasting a mortgage loan is one way to lower your monthly payments and pay less interest without refinancing.\nThe strategy involves putting a lump sum (such as $20,000) toward your loan principal and asking your loan servicer to recalculate the remaining payment schedule based on the new, lower balance.\nBorrowers often do a recast when they don’t want to change their mortgage rate and they have a large amount of cash on hand. It can also make sense when you’re several years into your repayment term, since your balance will be much smaller compared to when you originally took out the loan. This can help further shrink your new monthly payments.\nIf you’re considering a mortgage recast, you’ll need to discuss it with your loan servicer in advance. Some companies won’t recast loans, and ones that do may set a minimum lump-sum payment and charge a one-time fee.\nThough our current repayment term is 30 years, we’d like to pay off the debt in half that time. It’s hard to pinpoint a specific date when we’re not sure where mortgage rates will go and whether we’ll always have extra funds to put toward the loan.\nSome options, like making biweekly mortgage payments and putting rental money toward the loan principal, can help with this goal right now. Other options, like refinancing and recasting, may come into play at some point.\nBut together, these strategies will help lower our interest costs, put less of a burden on our budget and help us get out of debt faster.",

    "text": "While there’s no place like home, since the pandemic people are traveling like there’s no tomorrow. Wanderlust is all but an addiction, and travelers are hitting the road whether it’s good for their bank account or not.\nForty seven percent of participants in a recent survey from Allianz Travel Insurance said they couldn’t really afford a vacation this year but nearly half of them said they were likely to take one regardless. Similarly, in a Forbes Advisor survey, 30% of parents and 23% of non-parents polled said they were willing to go into debt to fund their travel.\nThe trend of vacationing now and paying later has a new phase — “justi-vacation.” You “justify” taking a vacation that you can’t afford for any number of reasons, like telling yourself you deserve it, or that it’s a bucket list trip.\nThere’s something to be said for living in the moment and seizing the day, but is it worth putting $5,000 to $10,000 or more on a credit card to travel?\nEli Itzhaki promised his wife they would finally take a break after all the years of grinding with their business Keyzoo Locksmiths. “Next thing I knew, I was staring at travel sites, booking tickets and borrowing around $10,000 to make it happen. It wasn’t exactly the smartest financial decision I’ve ever made, but I figured, why not just go for it?”\nLast year they went to Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and China. They spent time at beaches in Bali, got lost in the temples of Yogyakarta, shifted gears to the modern mecca of Singapore and in Malaysia had a bit of both worlds — the buzzing city life in Kuala Lumpur and the peaceful side of Cameron Highlands. As for China, he said, “It was like living inside a history book and a sci-fi movie at the same time. Shanghai’s skyscrapers one day and exploring ancient Xi’an the next.”\nHowever, “The debt felt heavy once the vacation buzz wore off,\" he said.\n\"It’s not like business is always predictable, so there were moments where I felt the pressure. It’s one thing to take a trip and make memories, but another to realize you’ve got a chunk of money to pay back while still juggling everything else. Had a few sleepless nights thinking, was that really the right call?”\nHe doesn’t regret the trip, but at times wished he had waited, saved more and taken a less expensive trip. “It took a while to bounce back from that hit to the wallet — no extras, no fancy dinners out, cutting back where we could,” he said. But at the same time, those memories — snorkeling in Bali, walking through Chinatown in Singapore, standing on the Great Wall in China — stick with him. “It’s not just the places; it’s how we got closer, the stuff we laughed about, the random mish that turn into inside jokes later.”\nHe says financing the trip was not ideal. “But in terms of living a little and keeping a promise, yeah, I think it had its own value. Would I do it the same way again? Probably not. But I wouldn’t trade the memories either, even if they came with a price tag.”\nJeff Powell and his wife took four trips this year: to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Haleakala National Park, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and Mammoth Cave National Park. They hiked, explored, ascended volcanoes, descended into caves and chased waterfalls and bears.\nWhile they used frequent flyer points to help pay for flights, they spent more than expected and put close to $5,000 on a credit card. Consequently, they canceled plans to go to Canada next year. They are eating out less and spending less on gifts and impulse buys.\nDespite the pinch, he said, “The memories my wife and I created are worth much more to me than the cost. Traveling together, exploring new places and spending time outdoors are all investments in our health and the health of our marriage. Nothing is more important to me than that.”\nAlex Langan, chief investment officer at Langan Financial Group, said, “I strongly advise against going into significant debt for a trip, even if it’s a bucket list experience. Travel is an important and rewarding part of life, but taking on thousands of dollars in debt, especially high-interest credit card debt, can set you back financially for years.”\nHe said the better move is to save for the trip. “This way, you can enjoy the experience without the financial stress of repayments, and you won't jeopardize other important financial goals like saving for retirement or maintaining an emergency fund.”\nFurthermore, be mindful not to max out your credit limits to take a trip. “Not only can this hurt your credit score, but it may leave you with no cushion should an emergency come up while traveling,” said Richard Barrington, a financial analyst for Credit Sesame.\nHe added, “Never borrow before figuring out how payments on that debt fit into your budget. This can give you valuable perspective on whether the debt is worth it. After all, if a two-week trip leaves you with years of financial stress, it hardly seems worthwhile.”\nThe only time travel debt makes sense is for once-in-a-lifetime events with fixed dates, such as a destination wedding or a trip to see a sick relative, said Kevin Shahnazari, founder and CEO of FinlyWealth. But even with those caveats, he said the debt shouldn’t exceed three months of disposable income.\nIf you use debt, use discipline and consider your overall financial health. Assess your current finances and any emergency funds, and determine whether your debts are under control and manageable.\n“If not, adding more debt could put undue strain on your finances,” said personal finance coach Michael Ryan of Michael Ryan Money. But if you have those things in place, a splurge may be OK.\n“If the experience is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that aligns with your values and personal growth, the emotional and experiential benefits may outweigh the financial costs,\" Ryan said.\n",

    "text": "The holiday season is here, which means quality time with family, cozy winter nights and Mariah Carey Christmas classics on repeat. But as adults, the holidays could also mean spending hundreds — and even thousands — of dollars on gifts for your loved ones.\nThe National Retail Federation (NRF) expects average consumer spending to reach a record high this year of $902 per person across gifts, food, decorations, and other seasonal items. This number is based on a consumer survey of 8,191 consumers conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics. The holiday retail forecast from Deloitte anticipates an even higher number of $1,778  (+8% from 2023) based on its survey of more than 4,000 U.S. consumers.\nYour budget might be well above or below these two numbers based on your financial situation. Still, it’s helpful to know what the average American plans to spend so you have an idea of what’s “normal” this holiday season.\nIf the thought of holiday spending makes your heart race and your palms sweaty, you’re not alone. Here’s how to welcome the new year without putting a dent in your wallet:\n“It's so easy to get ahead of yourself when you're shopping for Christmas,” Aaliyah Kissick, a Gen Z financial expert and CEO of a financial education company, the Financial Literacy Diaries, said. “You don't need an expensive program or fancy app to keep track of your spending. You can get a notecard with each person you're buying for, write the amount you want to spend on the front, and then tally up everything on the back. Make sure to include interest and shipping in your cost as well.”\nBlack Friday and Cyber Monday aren’t the only opportunities for big bargains. If you want to avoid the seasonal rush and hectic crowds, strategize your purchases by planning your holiday shopping around other major sales events, like Memorial Day, Amazon Prime Day, Fourth of July, Mother’s Day and St. Patrick’s Day. Spreading out your holiday purchases not only helps you avoid last-minute holiday stress but also the holiday shipping costs that can sometimes be more than the gift itself.\nAnd if you haven’t already, start saving for the holidays by setting up a sinking fund. A sinking fund is essentially a savings account you put aside for specific future expenses — holiday spending, in this case. To grow your money before the holiday rush, consider parking your sinking fund in high-yield savings accounts that often let you earn up to 5% APY. Just know that some savings accounts may limit you to six monthly withdrawals before you’re hit with fees.\nMany credit cards offer reward programs like cashback, points and miles. These rewards accrue based on your spending patterns and can help you save big during the holidays. According to recent Bank of America data, 40% of consumers say they plan to cover all or part of their holiday shopping by redeeming points or rewards. Here are a few ways you can use your credit card rewards to keep your holiday spending under control:\nIf you're looking for new items with the tags still on, Kissick suggests checking out platforms like ThredUp and Poshmark. These sites are treasure troves for never-worn clothing, accessories and even home goods.\n“You never know what you're going to find on the apps. Plus, you could potentially save hundreds if you’re buying holiday gifts for multiple people,” she said.\nAs those Santa figurines and mini Christmas trees start appearing in stores, it’s easy to feel tempted to revamp your holiday decor. But before you splurge, take last year’s decorations out of storage and see if you could reuse or repurpose them. There are do-it-yourself tutorials on Pinterest and YouTube that teach you how to redecorate your wreath with other materials or craft new ornaments from what you already have.\nAccording to Rocket Home’s findings, the average person in the U.S. spends approximately $269 on decorations each year. By reusing what you already own, you can save that amount and put it toward next year’s holiday budget.\nIf your budget is extra tight this season, don’t feel pressured to rack up crippling credit card debt just to buy gifts. Instead, be upfront about your situation.\n“Let your loved ones know you're focusing on financial wellness,” said Casey Brueske, community education development specialist and certified financial counselor at PenAir Credit Union. “And don’t be afraid to suggest alternative ways to celebrate, such as spending quality time together or creating lasting memories through experiences.”",

Companies like Amazon and Dell are making headlines by mandating employees return to the office three to five days a week.\nBut Dave Cairns, a \"Future of Work\" strategist at workplace software company Kadence, said most companies are taking another approach.\n\"According to a Flex Index study, 79% of tech companies in North America allow employees to decide when they work in the office (56%) or are fully remote (23%), 18% have a ‘structured’ hybrid mandate (specific days are mandated) and only 3% are fully in-office,\" Cairns said.\nProponents of RTO policies, however, cite collaboration, productivity and company culture as their drivers. Companies like Amazon and Dell argue in-person interaction is critical to productive teamwork.\nOthers, like Spotify, prove building strong, effective teams without a physical office is possible. Spotify has fully embraced remote work as part of its culture, trusting employees to manage their time. “You can’t spend a lot of time hiring grown-ups and then treat them like children,” Spotify claims, placing respect for employee autonomy at the center of its approach.\nHere is a closer look at what might be behind the push to bring people back to the office and why using data and employee feedback is essential to ensuring that RTO is the right choice.\nHistorically, office culture centered around managers who could easily “swing by” desks and oversee their teams face-to-face. This reinforced a clear power structure with a physical presence-based hierarchy. Managers who relied on in-person oversight found themselves managing from afar during the pandemic, which some perceived as a loss of control.\nRTO allows companies to reestablish this dynamic. Physical presence becomes a tool for control, making it easier to track arrival and departure times and establish accountability through visibility. For these companies, RTO is more about restoring traditional power dynamics than productivity gains.\nOffice space is costly, and remote work has left some companies paying for empty desks and meeting rooms, unused utilities and building maintenance. An RTO mandate can help justify these costs.\nSome companies are also influenced by pressure from local businesses that rely on office workers. As cities have seen drops in tax revenue, public transit use and local business profits, some companies face pressure from local governments to “help bring people back.” In these cases, RTO mandates are as much about supporting the local economy as company culture.\nRTO mandates can also be a strategic way for companies to reduce staff without layoffs or severance. For employees who value remote work for personal or practical reasons, RTO mandates may push them to resign and seek other opportunities.\nImplementing the RTO policy allows companies to trim headcount without the costs or reputational risks of traditional layoffs. By paying severance or unemployment, companies save money and avoid the backlash often associated with workforce cuts.\nAs CNN reports, President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental entity led by his allies Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is expected to push for an end to remote work across federal agencies as a way to help reduce the federal workforce through attrition.\nWhile some companies enforce RTO, others allow employees to choose where they work best. Spotify, for example, has committed to a remote-first model, trusting employees to manage their time and priorities. Their philosophy is simple: People work best when given autonomy and respect, balancing their work and personal lives without restrictions.\nCompanies like Spotify prioritize cultivating relationships and productivity, regardless of where their teams are. A 2023 Gartner report that employees are often more productive and satisfied when they control where and when they work. Flexible workplaces are also more inclusive, supporting women, people of color, caregivers and those with chronic health conditions.\n\"Don't try to recreate the old world. Imagine what can be.” According to Phil Libin, co-founder and CEO of mmhmm and All Turtles, co-founder and former CEO of Evernote.\nFrom Libin's perspective, the focus should be on managing distributed teams well. It is less about choosing a side and more about how to work more effectively regardless of companies’ 'work from' policies.\nSalvatore Affinito, assistant professor of management and organizations at NYU Stern School of Business, said it's important for companies ending remote work \"to make a compelling case to employees for why being in the office is important to company leadership.\"\n\"I think what many employees are hungry for is a clear rationale behind these initiatives and widespread role modeling from company leadership of using time in the office effectively,\" Affinito said.\nSuccessful RTO strategies are not based on assumptions or executive preference but on complex data and employee feedback, experts said. Companies must genuinely listen to their teams to understand how RTO policies affect different groups. With flexibility and an open mind, leadership can reduce the turnover and disengagement that often result from enforcing rigid policies.\n“Leadership must prioritize supporting middle managers,\" Phoebe Gavin, a career and leadership coach, said. \"[They] face pressures from multiple angles: their supervisors, who may push them to enforce policies they didn’t create; their lives, which are affected by the changes; and their direct reports, who may be unhappy with the new direction.”\nA flexible RTO strategy helps companies retain talent by addressing challenges like long commutes and childcare costs, which stricter mandates often overlook, experts said.\nThe best RTO policies respect individual needs, allowing employees to work in ways that suit them best. Companies can build a culture that fosters growth, inclusivity and productivity by focusing less on mandates and more on flexibility and trust.",

    "title": "I'm a freelancer. Should I change my business entity?",
    "author": "Kim Porter",
    "date": "December 2, 2",
    "text": "The U.S. is home to 76.4 million freelancers, a number that has been steadily increasing every year since 2017. By 2028, some estimates predict the freelance population to grow to 90 million.\nMany of these freelancers start out as sole proprietorships, which is the default business structure.\n“It’s a good place to start for a lot of people,” said Lawrence Sprung, a certified financial planner and wealth adviser. “Depending on what the business is, you may need to progress from there at a later date.”\nMoving from a sole prop to another business structure could offer perks, like the opportunity to add partners, reduce your personal liability and even lower your tax bill. Which is right for you?\nA business entity is the legal structure you choose for your business. This decision affects how you can raise capital for your business, how much you pay in taxes, the paperwork you need to file and your personal liability. When choosing your structure, look at the benefits and drawbacks of each type.\nBest for: A hobby or side business with one owner\nA sole proprietorship is a business that’s owned and run by a single person. This is the default business structure — so if you don’t set up a separate LLC or corporation, you’ll automatically operate as a sole proprietor. This entity type is easy to set up and shut down, and you get complete control over the company.\nAll income flows through the business to the owner, who reports profits and losses on their personal tax return. That income is only taxed once — a clear advantage over the C corp structure, where corporate profits are taxed once as an entity and then again individually for each shareholder.\nBut sole proprietors have to pay both parts of the self-employment tax on all income, whereas S corps can get a break here. You also take on more risk because there’s no legal separation between the owner and the business. Plus, you may have trouble qualifying for business loans, since banks often want to see a formal business structure.\nFor all these reasons, sole props are best for less-complicated businesses that are just starting out. “For example, you’re getting revenue from a side gig, and it doesn’t make sense at this point to form a company because there’s not a lot of meat there yet,” Sprung said.\nOnce you're sure the business will take off, Sprung added, it's typically best to switch over to an LLC or corporation.\nBest for: A hobby or side business with more than one owner\nA partnership is the default structure for businesses that have more than one owner. So when setting up your business, consider whether it’s the right choice.\nA partnership can help relieve some of the pressures and expenses of being in business by yourself. You also get to share knowledge and divide work based on each partner’s skill set, and the business is easy to set up and shut down.\nBut partners take on their own set of challenges, like figuring out how to split profits and resolve internal conflicts. And partners take on more risk compared to LLCs and corporations because each owner is personally liable for all of the partnership’s debts and lawsuits.\nLike a sole prop, a partnership is considered a pass-through entity for tax purposes. The business income and losses are passed to the partners and reported on their individual federal tax returns. Those profits are taxed only once, offering an advantage over C corporations.\nBest for: Companies that want to avoid personal liability and choose their tax treatment\nA limited liability company, or LLC, has become a popular legal entity because it combines the limited liability of corporations with the flexibility and tax characteristics of sole proprietorships or partnerships.\nWhen you form an LLC, the business becomes a separate legal entity (reducing your risk in the process) and owns the business assets.\nLLCs also provide more options when it comes to tax treatment. You can choose to be taxed like a sole prop, partnership, C corp or S corp, which means you can be an employee of your business.\nBest for: LLC owners who earn enough to pay themselves a salary\nAn S corp is a type of corporation that’s considered a “pass-through” entity, where profits and some losses flow through to the owners. Avoiding the double-taxation drawback of regular C corps is a major benefit to S corp shareholders.\nAnother perk of running an S corp: “Freelancers who are making enough money to pay themselves a ‘reasonable salary’ can avoid paying self-employment/FICA taxes on any additional profits,” said M. Zane Johnson, the founder of MZA Legal, a virtual law firm that specializes in business formation. “This can result in hundreds or thousands of dollars in tax savings.”\nIf you’re already set up as an LLC, you don’t even have to change business entities to be taxed as an S corp. Instead, you can simply fill out a form with the IRS, which is a much simpler process.\nIf you’re thinking of changing your business structure, Sprung recommends talking with tax and legal professionals or a financial adviser who has experience with both ends of the equation. They should run an analysis based on last year’s business tax return and discuss the pros and cons of each entity type.\n“This will help you see if there are tax savings or legal benefits from making that shift,” Sprung said. “If in the end, you don’t need the protection and there are no tax benefits, you might be better off staying where you are.”\nBut if you decide to move forward with the switch, here’s a quick overview of what you may need to do:",

    "title": "Managing finances for the Sandwich Generation",
    "author": "Kim Porter",
    "date": "December 1, 2",
    "text": "About a quarter of Americans are part of the sandwich generation, a group of adults who are financially supporting their children while also helping their aging parents with finances and health issues. Men and women are equally stepping into this role, usually while in their 30s and 40s, according to a 2023 New York Life survey.\nThough caregiving can be a positive experience, nearly half of those survey respondents say it has impacted their personal finances. Many report contributing less (or nothing) to their retirement and emergency savings, taking on more debt, or cutting back on expenses while juggling care for their parents and kids.\nBut undermining your own financial security can lead to more problems, said Cameron Huddleston, a journalist and author of “Mom and Dad, We Need to Talk,” a book that helps adults communicate with their aging parents about finances.\n“You’re only going to perpetuate that cycle, and your own kids are going to need to step in later on and perhaps support you if you don’t have the resources,” said Huddleston, who provided care for her mother while raising three young kids with her husband.\nIf you find yourself in this demographic, there are ways to help your parent and ensure your own financial security in the process.\nIf you’re thinking about moving your parent into your home or financially helping in some capacity, go through your current budget. Or create one by calculating your take-home pay and listing your recurring expenses. If you have funds left over after covering your bills and having a little bit of spending money, earmark those funds for savings or debt payoff.\nNow, figure out whether any of your expenses will increase or if you need to add new line items after your parent moves in. Then talk with your parent about whether they can fill those gaps or find other ways to contribute to the household finances. While asking Mom to pay rent might not go well, Huddleston said, it’s perfectly acceptable to ask her to chip in for groceries, utilities or gas money.\n“They would have been covering those costs anyway in their home, and they’re saving money already if they’re not paying for a mortgage anymore or paying for the upkeep of a home,” Huddleston said.\nParents usually need to move in with their adult kids because of some type of medical issue. Depending on what they need help with, you might be able to handle it yourself if you’re already staying at home to care for young kids.\nBut if you and your partner both work or the parent needs more advanced health care, you’ll need to consider how you’ll cover the costs.\nThe least expensive option is enrolling your parent in adult day health care, where they receive social and health care services in a group setting. Nationally, families can expect to spend $2,058 a month on this type of service. Hiring a home health aid is another option, though it triples your costs — $6,292 per month on average.\nSome caregivers may be able to leverage their parent’s assets to cover these expenses. For instance, Huddleston sold her mother’s house and used the proceeds to pay for home-based health care services. “I knew this would be the best way to stretch her resources out as much as possible and care for her,” Huddleston said.\nAlternatively, people with very limited resources may qualify for Medicaid benefits. In some states, Medicaid may even pay you to act as a caregiver for your aging parent. The American Council on Aging provides a list of Medicaid’s home and community-based services by state on its website.\nYou can also reach out to any Council on Aging chapter near you for a list of resources or information about adult day health care and home-based care.\nStashing money away for your retirement and emergency savings can help secure your financial future, so it should be a non-negotiable expense in your budget. First, try to set aside three to six months’ worth of expenses in a dedicated emergency fund. This account can help you cover bills and living expenses during a financial emergency, like a job loss.\nIf your workplace offers a 401(k) or similar retirement plan, contribute enough to secure any company match that’s offered to you. Then consider increasing your contributions as much as possible.\nYou can also deposit pretax money into a health savings account (HSA), and later use those funds in retirement for qualified medical expenses.\nIf you don’t have access to a workplace retirement plan or you want to save beyond the annual contribution limits, consider opening an individual retirement account (IRA) or a regular brokerage account.\nWhile it might be uncomfortable to discuss health and financial matters with your parent, it’s a crucial part of caretaking. First, make sure your parent adds beneficiaries to all financial accounts, such as bank accounts, retirement accounts, life insurance policies and annuities.\nYour parent may also decide to grant you durable power of attorney, which allows you to handle their finances and make medical decisions if they cannot. Another legal document, a will, allows your parent to distribute their property and other assets after their death.\nSome of these documents have to be drafted and signed while your parent is still mentally competent. If there is memory loss, it doesn’t mean it’s too late. Huddleston suggests speaking with an elder law attorney for guidance.\nShe offers another pro tip: Make sure your own documents are in order while you arrange your parent’s finances.\nGetting logistical and emotional support can help you prevent mental burnout and financial stress, so it’s an important step.\nStart by talking with your siblings or other family members. If they live nearby, ask them to drive Mom or Dad to their doctor’s appointment, cook meals or stay with your parent while you take a vacation. If they don’t live near you, ask them to chip in financially. And for small favors, consider reaching out to good friends or asking for volunteers at your place of worship.\nIt’s also important to realize you’ll need to make trade-offs, since “you can’t give 100% to all the people who are counting on you,” Huddleston said. Those trade-offs might mean hiring someone a few days a week to watch your parent or having a conversation with your boss about adjusting your work schedule.\n“Remind yourself it will be temporary,” Huddleston said. “It’s going to be tough for a while, but there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.”",

    "title": "Gen Z, millennials struggle with money dysmorphia",
    "author": "Jamela Adam",
    "date": "November 30, 2",
    "text": "If you find yourself constantly worrying about money, obsessively checking your bank account, comparing your net worth to others,and feeling inadequate even though you’re on solid financial footing, you might have money dysmorphia.\nLong story short, money dysmorphia is when you develop an unrealistic and distorted view of your finances, making you believe that your financial situation is worse than it actually is.\nAccording to a Credit Karma survey, around one-third of Americans experience a distorted view of their finances. However, Gen Z and millennials seem to struggle with it more than other groups. Credit Karma found that around 43% of Gen Z and 41% of millennials feel behind financially even though they actually have above-average savings. And approximately 45% of them are obsessed with the idea of becoming rich.\nKristie Tse, psychotherapist and founder of Uncover Mental Health Counseling, believes it stems from the deep-seated beliefs about worth and the narratives we heard about money, success and failure as children.\n“In my experience with clients, cultural narratives and family dynamics profoundly influence these beliefs,” she said. “As a psychotherapist, I see how societal pressures and generational teachings about money can distort one’s financial self-image. Specifically, people from marginalized communities may internalize negative stereotypes about economic potential, which complicates their relationship with money.”\nIn other words, this feeling of shame or unease about having or spending money is usually rooted in some kind of unresolved emotion or perception picked up early on.\nAnother culprit is the endless cycle of social comparison. Today, social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram are flooded with influencers flaunting their luxury purchases, vacations to exotic locations, and six-figure savings by their mid-20s. And when Gen Z and Millennials — who spend so much of their time on these platforms — are bombarded with these highlight reels, it’s easy for them to feel inadequate and anxious about their finances.\nAlthough medical professionals don’t officially recognize money dysmorphia as a clinical diagnosis, this disconnect surrounding your finances can undermine your financial well-being, damage your self-esteem, and disrupt your sense of control.\nAccording to Chelsea Williams, chief financial architect at Core Solutions Group and the creator of Money Mastery, some signs and behaviors that indicate you might be experiencing money dysmorphia are avoidance of things such as financial planning, looking at your bank statements, or even discussions of money. Another sign is fearing spending or feeling poor even when you're not.\n“Feeling compelled to earn more, even if you're already financially independent, is also a sign of money dysmorphia,” she said. “Negative shopping habits such as buying expensive items to feel adequate or feeling ashamed after spending are also signs.”\nMoney dysmorphia isn’t a condition that sticks with you forever. If you think you might suffer from money dysmorphia, Tse believes the first step to overcoming it is to reframe your old narratives about money.\n“It's essential to identify and challenge negative narratives about money you've internalized, often shaped by cultural or family dynamics. As a psychotherapist, I focus on helping my clients unravel these emotions and beliefs linked to their financial self-image,” she said.\nOne way to start unraveling these beliefs is by journaling. Williams recommends jotting down the fears about money that are holding you back. Then, write down positive affirmations that challenge your old fear and give you permission to think of a new thought that will serve you.\n“That way, when your negative thoughts and fears come up, as they surely will, you've got a positive thought ready to take over instead of continuing the old line of thinking,” she said.\nIt’s entirely possible to rewire your brain to create a healthier money mindset. “Your thoughts are neurological pathways laid out in your brain. The more you think a thought, the stronger that neurological pathway becomes,” Williams explained. Journaling builds awareness of these thoughts as they arise and reinforces your ability to choose new, healthier patterns over the old ones.\nWhen you see someone your age with a $500,000 savings account or a million-dollar home, it’s easy to start questioning if you’re falling behind and even develop symptoms of money dysmorphia.\nBut remember, social media is just a highlight reel. Most people only post their successes and leave out the debt, sacrifices, and hard work that might go on behind the scenes. Plus, you’re on your own path and financial journey. Comparing yourself to others who might have had family support or different life circumstances isn’t fair to you — or realistic.\nThat said, if you’re still feeling anxious about money and can’t help comparing your financial situation to others, consider seeking support from a psychologist or financial therapist. They can help you address the root causes of these feelings and build a healthier relationship with money.",

    "text": "At this year’s New York Comic Con, held last month at Manhattan’s 3.3-million-square-foot Jacob K Javits Center, I stood before a dinosaur-sized inflatable Goku — the protagonist from the Dragon Ball Z franchise — with over 200,000 fanboys and fangirls swirling around me. Everyone was hunting for exclusive bobbleheads.\nNew York Comic Con is the East Coast’s biggest ode to pop culture. It's a four-day convention that is less about comic books themselves and more about accumulating pins and posters and hoodies and mystery boxes exploding with stuff you will never use. There are vendors selling replicas of Thor’s hammer. Life-sized glow-in-the-dark Slimers. Lightsabers that can power your house. It's geek fashion week, and everyone competes for who has the best cosplay, spending months and thousands to dress as their favorite characters. Those who don’t cosplay are decked out in geek swag, acting as billboards for their chosen properties.\nI came with $100 cash in my pocket — much less than most folks there — and I was ready to blow it on Marvel shirts, hats and action figures. But I was just so bored with it all.\nIt was a terrifying realization for someone whose life revolved around geek culture and toys, especially as we climbed towards the apex of the shopping year: Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Small Business Saturday, plus regular Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday — all spectacular times to find deals on action figures during the holiday season.\nEvery year, November and December would fly by as I scrolled the Target and Walmart and Amazon and eBay sites hunting for the newest Spider-Man figures, yearning for that same jolt of excitement I had when I first began collecting as a pre-teen.\nI’m not alone. For the first time, according to a 2024 Circana study, in the first quarter of this year, American adults spent more on toys for themselves than for preschoolers, shelling out over $1.5 billion in sales in the first three months. In the past year, a whopping 43% of adults purchased themselves a toy. Similar trends are happening in the UK. As the toy industry struggles, sales to adults are skyrocketing, and toy companies are marketing nostalgia, releasing figures that remind folks of their youth.\nShopping for toys gave my droll winter workdays meaning. It made parenting less wearying when I could flick through my kids’ toy catalogs, searching for the toys I wanted. When your days are monotonous — working and changing diapers and driving kids to school — scoring a rare collectible makes you feel accomplished.\nAnd the season of giving — to myself — begins in October, with Comic Con. Other than a couple of years during the pandemic, I’ve attended every New York Comic Con for more than a decade.\nEven preparing for the con was exciting for the shopper in me. I needed to plan my outfits, the bag I'd carry all my goodies in without breaking my back, the shoes that would help me not destroy my ankles while I stood in lines for panels. For months, I would refresh comic news websites hourly for the latest drops for the con and holiday season that I wouldn’t be able to afford.\nOver the years, I’ve filled many roles at the con, many of which let me in before the normies, so I could be first in line for swag. I’ve attended on a professional pass as a school social worker learning how to incorporate comic curriculum into my programming. I’ve written for random comic websites that pay me nothing but offer free press passes. I’ve elbowed my way through twisting lines to secure exclusives that I sell within minutes on eBay so I could afford more exclusives for myself.\nI had a comics-themed bar mitzvah, and Comic Con was that times a million. I grew into adulthood, getting married and starting my own family, secure with my action figures and comics by my side. Life changed, but Spider-Man didn’t. Family and friends aged and died, but Aunt May never did.\nNow that I own a house, I have more physical space than ever, but less space to collect anything. This is because I have a ton of little people living with me: a 6-year-old, a 4-year-old, and a 1-and-a-half-year-old. And they all have their own toys, spilling out of every crevice. Now, my collection of action figures has been pushed into the scorching attic. All my unopened Pop! bobbleheads have been discovered by my kids, their packaging torn to pieces and heads ripped off. To marvel at my 30th anniversary X-Men Hologram Set — which is still miraculously sealed! — I need to schlep upstairs and battle through the walls of spider webs.\nBut I can delve into memories without moving an inch. One of the first years I attended Comic Con, I volunteered to write for a now-defunct geek website to secure that coveted press pass. I scored an interview with Darryl McDaniels, the iconic black-hatted co-founder of pioneering hip-hop group Run-D.M.C., who was promoting his new comic. He was a comic book geek himself who overcame addiction and had the gentlest voice. Before we chatted, he had to use the restroom, so he spirited me backstage along with his crew.\nOutside the bathroom, he stopped to talk with his friend Stan Lee, the co-creator of the Marvel Universe, who was then in his 90s. I attempted to play it cool. I didn’t want to burst with excitement, so I held my breath and didn’t move, and for that moment, I was just part of DMC’s entourage, chatting with the man who created my childhood. It’s a memory no one can take from me, one that will never be stuffed into the attic. I’m still buds with one of the members of DMC’s crew.\nThis year, I went into the city for three days to attend the con. It was my first time not cuddling my son to bed since the pandemic started. Instead of forcing myself to trek to Javits every day, I only attended for two days, spending less than six hours total at the con. When I was there, I hung out with my cousin — the dude who introduced me to comics with a Fantastic Four annual all those decades ago. When I shopped, I shopped for my kids, searching for the perfect pins based on their favorite properties: Spider Gwen for my daughter and Pikachu for my son. The 1-year-old didn’t need anything. Neither did I.\nThe truth was, I still had a great weekend. During my years writing about comics — often for free — I built relationships with people I adored. I spent an hour debating the Jewish influence on the Skrull’s invasion of the Marvel Universe with the author of one of my favorite books on Jewish comic history, and I was invited to eat Shabbat dinner with the former comics editor at Heeb Magazine, one of the greatest magazines ever. Over delicious homemade challah, we discussed classic graphic novels, many of which he edited.\nThe more I find myself distanced from the clutter of action figures and collectibles, the more I find myself loving comics. I re-read comics and am blasted back to moments of my life that I cherish. Issues of X-Men from the '90s zip me into the backseat of my parent’s car, safe with them at the wheel. I read issues of Avengers and feel the same way I did on my wedding day when I read them to distract me from my anxiety. Today, I still purchase physical comics to support my local comic shop, but I read most issues digitally, with my babies cradled close after bedtimes.\nI’ll even try and enjoy myself this Chanukah season. Sure, I’ll still flip through my kids’ catalogs, but I feel a sense of relief knowing I won’t spend entire days scouring the web for a few bucks off a figure I will never open. Next year, I’ll still trek to Comic Con with a hefty bag and good shoes, but it won’t be the same. What matters these days isn’t the stuff I accumulate. My kids just destroy it anyhow. But I’ve got great relationships and memories that aren’t going anywhere, and I’m creating new ones every day.",

    "author": "Elizabeth Hlavinka",
    "date": "November 28, 2",
    "text": "When scouting the state for wild turkeys to include in data collection, researchers found one nest right next to a rail road track in the middle of a 10-yard stretch of the road’s median, said Nicolle De Filippo, a PhD student at Ohio State University studying turkey disappearances.\n“Surprisingly, she hatched one bird,” De Filippo told Salon in a phone interview. “It didn't survive very long, but it just shows their resilience — that even when they're nesting in something that is terrible, such as the side of the road next to a train, they can make it happen.”\nAlthough most of the turkeys taking center stage on Thanksgiving dinner tables this week probably come from farms, turkeys do roam wild in many U.S. states. Considered one of the country’s greatest conservation success stories, wild turkeys made a comeback after facing near-extinction in the 20th century. But in the past decade or so, turkey populations have again declined in some regions, and scientists studying this phenomenon are unsure why.\n“It's probably not one specific cause, and there's not going to be a silver bullet that's driving turkey population decline,” said Dan Kaminski, a wildlife research biologist with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources studying turkeys. “It's probably a combination of factors.”\nAs colonists landed in North America in the 1600s, they destroyed huge swaths of the native turkey’s forest habitat to make room for agriculture and nearly hunted the bird into extinction. By the 1930s, it’s estimated that fewer than 30,000 turkeys survived — which is roughly how many polar bears exist today.\nTurkeys weren’t the only animals pushed to the brink of extinction through colonization, and sharp decreases in bison, prairie dogs, and passenger pigeon populations led the government to pass a series of some of the first conservation laws designed to protect them. While the damage was done for species like bison, which were often exterminated to starve Indigenous people, these laws helped wild turkeys bounce back across the country. By 2004, the wild population had ballooned to 7 million.\nWhile turkey populations continue to bloom in some parts of the country like parts of the West and Northeast, their populations have declined in eight states across the South and Midwest within the last decade. One 2023 study published in Ecology & Evolution estimates that the population of one species of turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) found in the East declined by roughly 9% annually over the past 50 years. In Kansas and Oklahoma, two of the states with the largest declines, turkey populations have decreased by 60% since 2007 and 51% between 2014 and 2019, respectively.\n“In some areas, wild turkeys are doing great and are even considered kind of a nuisance, with stories of people having to shush them out of their neighborhood, or getting into those human-wildlife conflicts,” De Filippo said. “But in our situation and in other states in the Southeast, we are actually seeing that nest success rate, or the ability of hens to successfully make babies, is suffering.”\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox?

In Oklahoma, research suggests turkey populations could be declining due to an increase in the number of predators such as raccoons, possums or coyotes, feeding on their eggs or hens before they are able to mature, De Filippo said.\n“She’s really vulnerable when she is in that nest,” De Filippo said. “She is sitting on the ground for two weeks, so anything can come and flush her off and eat the eggs.”\nHabitat loss is also probably contributing to declining populations. Turkeys like to nest in grasslands or open forests. However, the U.S. has lost over 80% of its grasslands in the past decade due to agriculture, urban development, and invasive species. In Iowa, 45% of grasslands have been lost since 1990, Kaminski said.\nThese losses affect many wild birds, and populations of several species that inhabit grasslands and open forests like turkeys have declined to a fraction of what their population once was. Prescribed burns in certain forests can help clear out forests to make them more suitable for turkey breeding and have been performed for this purpose by the U.S. Forest Service.\nTurkeys have adapted and shown resiliency despite these habitat changes, Kaminski said. Like De Filippo, his research team often finds nests in odd places, with 10% of turkey nests in the state found in road ditches or patches of grass near waterways.\n“These are not big, robust prairie fields — they are just little, narrow habitats that aren’t great for them,” Kaminski told Salon in a phone interview. “We have not seen a single successful nest out of a road ditch, but that is the available grassland habitat they are selecting.”\nOther factors could be influencing the population as well, such as a massive decline in food sources like insects or disease outbreaks. Some states authorize people to hunt turkeys, but many that are experiencing declining populations have paused this practice until turkeys can be repopulated.\nIt could also be that turkey populations overshot their carrying capacity in the '80s and '90s and are now declining to a “new normal,” Kaminski said.\nVarious research projects have been launched in Kansas, Iowa, Oklahoma and other states to try and better understand what’s behind declining turkey populations. Besides serving as a national cultural symbol, turkeys play an important role in the environment, dispersing seeds and helping to control invertebrate populations. They also serve as an important food source for large predators like bobcats in the Southeast.\nMoreover, turkeys have had cultural significance for many tribes long before colonists threatened the bird the first time around. In Oklahoma, the Muskogee tribe has also launched turkey rehabilitation program to try and get these birds back.\nAlthough climate change is expected to further reduce the habitats available for turkeys to breed, through these efforts, some states are seeing early signs that turkeys could once again s back.\n“After I left my master’s project and another student came in to finish out the grant, they had a successful hatch that actually made it to independence, which was something we hadn't seen in the last two years,” De Filippo said. “While it might not sound like the greatest number since it's only one brood surviving to independence, it's at least a little bit better than had been, and I think that little glimmer of hope helps.”",

    "text": "As America gears up for the year's end and a change in administration, the topic of public health has dominated many conversations throughout the election season, but one facet has been noticeably absent: bird flu. Human infections of the H5N1 virus have sharply risen in the last few weeks, alarming many public health experts are wondering — and worried — what this means for another possible pandemic like COVID-19.\nThis week, public health officials detected bird flu in a sample of raw milk sold in California. According to a press release by the California Department of Public Health, the public is being advised to avoid consuming “one batch of cream top, whole raw milk” produced by the brand Raw Farm. The news comes after public health experts have warned that drinking or accidentally inhaling raw milk containing the bird flu virus may lead to illness.\nIt also comes at a time as the country’s incoming Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continues to promote the consumption of raw milk. Just this past summer, Kennedy bragged to an audience at an event that he only drinks raw milk, and more recently, claimed the Food and Drug Administration’s so-called “war on public health” includes “suppression” of raw milk.\nThe bird flu crisis began several years ago but ramped up last April when dairy cows started becoming infected. Since then, 55 human cases have been reported across several states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of these infections occurred in farmworkers who came into contact with infected cows or poultry, with the exception of three cases that are mystifying health officials. The first is a case in Missouri in which health officials have yet to track the origins of the infection. The second is a Canadian teenager who has remained hospitalized in critical condition with bird flu, again with unknown exposure and stark in its severity. (No other bird flu infections in this crisis have required hospitalization.) The third is a case of a child in California, also with an unknown source of the infection.\nSince last spring, public health officials have publicly criticized the Biden administration for not properly handling and monitoring the situation, but they don’t have faith that the situation will improve under a Trump administration, either. In fact, they imagine things will only intensify, just like how the Trump admin botched the response to COVID.\n“If the Biden administration is not doing a good job, you can only imagine when you have certain individuals who are much more hostile towards these types of government action, it will get worse,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Salon in a phone interview. “It would be important for the Trump administration, as it's rolling out its team that's going to be heading CDC, HHS, USDA, that they talk about bird flu and how their plan may differ, and how they're going to correct the deficiencies that are occurring currently.”\nAdalja added that the new Secretary of Agriculture is going to have to address bird flu, given that it spreads so much in factory farmed animals. Recently, news broke that Trump picked Brooke Rollins as his agriculture secretary, who has been influential in two right-leaning think tanks. \"Brooke’s commitment to support the American Farmer, defense of American Food Self-Sufficiency, and the restoration of Agriculture-dependent American Small Towns is second to none,\" Trump said in the statement.\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter Lab Notes.\nBut part of the problem in managing H5N1, Adalja said, has been the conflict between public health and the farm economy. Currently, the approach to monitoring bird flu in dairy cows is fragmented and depends on each state's cooperation. The CDC only mandates testing for herds if they’re traveling from one state to another.\n“What I think has constrained this entire outbreak response from the beginning is the fact that dairy cattle farmers do not want anything to impact their short-term economic interests,” Adalja said. “But they’re sacrificing the long-term for the short-term because they're not understanding that, if this [virus] becomes endemic in cattle, that's a major [financial] problem. And if it continues to affect humans and threaten their workforce, that's a major problem.”\nDr. Rajendram Rajnarayanan, of the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Arkansas, told Salon he’s concerned about proposed cuts to staff at various government agencies and how that will affect the future of bird flu monitoring. For example, Kennedy has claimed that he will gut the FDA once in power. Elon Musk, co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency — which is not an official government agency but acts as an advisory group to the Trump admin — has said they will recommend reducing headcounts to cut costs at federal departments.\n“Cuts to these agencies could severely diminish their capacity to monitor and respond to emerging infectious diseases,” Rajnarayanan said. “The ability to conduct epidemiological studies and implement public health measures relies heavily on its workforce, reducing capacity may lead to significantly slower response times and create unnecessary gaps in surveillance thereby increasing the risk of a disease spreading undetected among both animal and human populations.”\nOne of the biggest fears regarding this outbreak of H5N1 is if human-to-human transmission is occurring. Rajnarayanan said one primary indicator of human-to-human transmission will be “the occurrence of clusters of cases where individuals have not had direct contact with infected animals.” He pointed to the recent California case as an example. Notably, the CDC states its risk assessment for the general public is low.\n“The CDC, FDA and USDA must work together seamlessly to manage outbreaks,” Rajnarayanan said. “Staff reductions could disrupt this collaboration, as seen during the current H5N1 outbreak where farmers and local officials have expressed reluctance to cooperate with federal health officials due to concerns over jurisdiction and trust.”\nA “weakened CDC,” Rajnarayanan added, could exacerbate current tensions between the farm and public health sector, making it “harder to implement necessary biosecurity measures on farms.”\nRegarding an ideal response from the next administration, Rajnarayanan said he’d like to see more biosecurity measures, comprehensive surveillance, and investments in research, as well as the development of rapid testing, therapeutics and vaccines.\nAdalja said he’d like to see the next administration be much more “aggressive” with active cases.\n“Instead of being reactive, being very proactive, and saying we're going to assume that this is widespread, that it's not just in the 600 plus herds that have been identified,” he told Salon. “And encourage states to do testing of asymptomatic cows that are not meant for interstate travel.”\nThe previous Trump administration, Adalja said, was “destroyed by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Infectious disease should be top of mind.\n“They should have this realization about how important infectious disease emergency response is,” Adalja said. “This is something that the HHS and CDC nominees need to be asked about, this is one of the pressing infectious disease threats right now — even if this doesn't cause a pandemic, they need to get this right, put systems in place.”",

    "text": "Over the weekend, California state health officials warned the public to avoid drinking raw milk from a Fresno-based dairy farm that was being sold in stores. H5N1, the virus driving the current bird flu outbreak, was detected in a retail milk sample.\n“No illnesses associated with this lot of raw milk have been reported,” the state department of public health said in a statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, and due to the ongoing spread of bird flu in dairy cows, poultry and sporadic human cases, consumers should not consume any of the affected raw milk.”\nAs part of the state’s bird flu response, public health officials have been testing retail raw milk to help prevent consumers from getting the virus. Drinking raw milk, or having it splash in a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, can be one way that a person can get infected. Stores are being encouraged to toss Raw Farm products with lot ID #20241109. The company issued a voluntary recall. Though it is currently unknown if someone can contract bird flu from drinking raw milk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 4.4% of U.S. adults consume unpasteurized milk at least once a year.\nSince April, public health departments have found bird flu infections in 55 people, with all but two linked to poultry or cattle exposure. More than half of those have been in California and many of those in recent weeks. This month, the state of California also detected a bird flu infection in a child in the Bay Area whom did not have contact with farm animals, leaving unanswered questions regarding sources of exposure. The more cases in humans, the greater the risk of the H5N1 virus mutating to spread more efficiently between people, risking another pandemic like COVID-19.\n“The child is recovering from their illness,” the CDC wrote in a release. “An investigation by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) into the child's possible H5N1 exposure source is ongoing.”",

    "title": "Uranus is weirder than we thought: Scientists report new mysteries of the tilted planet",
    "author": "Matthew Rozsa",
    "date": "December 1, 2",
    "text": "A pale blue-green enigma, the planet Uranus has long fascinated astronomers precisely because of its extreme distance, some 1.6 billion miles (2.6 billion km) from Earth. While it is comparatively easy to gaze upon neighboring celestial bodies like the Moon and the planets Mars and Venus, Uranus is difficult to see without the most powerful telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope. As technology has advanced, it has unlocked more secrets of the strange, tilted planet (it orbits on its side compared to other planets in the solar system), from the fact that it may rain diamonds to discovering previously-unknown moons.\nNow a trio of recent studies has revealed that one of its moons, Miranda, likely has a stirring ocean beneath its surface, meaning it could harbor extraterrestrial life, and that the planet’s own internal dynamics are more bizarre than we ever imagined.\nIn a study published in The Planetary Science Journal, University of North Dakota astronomer Caleb Strong explained that their research revealed Miranda likely has a subsurface ocean, which Strong described as “weird.”\n“It was not expected based on previous estimates of its size, which means there are likely many surprises awaiting us in the Uranus system,” Strong told Salon.\nMiranda is one of the moons orbiting the planet Uranus in the Solar System. (Getty Images/Corey Ford/Stocktrek Images)\nHe added that it is premature to assume the presence of oceans means there is life on the planet, telling Salon that “we really don't know enough about Miranda or the Uranus system to say. While interesting, the question of life is beyond the scope of our paper.”\nAstrobiologists believe that extraterrestrial life, if it exists, would require a planet or planetary moon with water and carbon in order to form organic molecules, which is why there is interest in Miranda. The Miranda paper relied on images taken from the Voyager 2 probe, the one and only spacecraft to visit Uranus, to reach these conclusions. The Voyager 2 probe was also used by a recent study from the journal Nature Astronomy which used those images to learn about the magnetosphere of Uranus. A magnetosphere is the region around a planet where its magnetic field is dominant, protecting the planet from the Sun’s destructive particles. According to Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, past space voyages have provided mysterious readings about the exact nature of the Uranus magnetosphere. Their new research transforms everything.\nThis image of Uranus from NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope exquisitely captures Uranus’s seasonal north polar cap and dim inner and outer rings. (NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI)“Our findings change the view that the Uranus system is an extreme environment pertaining to intense radiation belts and a magnetosphere (or magnetic bubble) that has no plasma from the moons,” Jasinski said. “These were two major mysteries leftover from the Voyager 2 flyby, both of which can be reasonably explained by the arrival of an intense solar wind event that compressed the magnetosphere dramatically just before the flyby started i.e. squashing the magnetosphere to about 20% of its size.”\nThis finding has implications for another moon with an ocean, Enceladus, which orbits Saturn. Because of the strong magnetosphere of its host planet, the water on Enceladus is ionized and gets trapped within the Uranus magnetosphere. While scientists expected to see this same ionization near the Uranus moons, they were surprised to see a “vacuum magnetosphere” with no water ions. This made them speculate that the moons are inert with no ongoing activity, but that assumption was literally smashed when they realized a solar wind event had impacted Uranus several days before Voyager 2’s flyby. The astronomers realized that this could have increased the plasma loss and emptied the magnetosphere of evidence of lunar activity, and similarly could have explained the intense electron radiation belts they observed.\n“If we had arrived a week earlier with Voyager 2, then the spacecraft would have made completely different measurements, and our discoveries would have been very different. Voyager 2 arrived at just the wrong time!” Jasinski said.\nThe scientists who studied Miranda also used Voyager 2 to discern features they may have otherwise missed.\nAstronomers have detected X-rays from Uranus using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory. (NASA/CXO/University College London/W. Dunn et al; Optical: W.M. Keck Observatory)“Miranda may have a thin ice shell (~30 km/18 miles), which would explain why it has the weird ridge structures that would have formed in response to severe tidal stress. And of course it may have a subsurface ocean,” Strong said. “Its subsurface ocean is likely to be relatively deep (~100 km/62 miles) compared to the estimated depth, say of the ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus (~10 km/6 miles).”\nThe final recent paper was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Based on the data, also acquired from Voyager 2, researchers led by a University of California Berkeley professor of earth and planetary science speculates that the surface of Uranus is layered and, like oil and water, the two layers never mix.\n“After working on this project for more than ten years, I opened my laptop one morning and could not believe my eyes,” Militzer said. “The materials in my computer simulations had formed two separate layers, a bit like oil and water. This was my ‘Eureka’ moment and became the basis of the new paper.”\nAs for the paper itself, it is “primarily about the interiors and the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune, not about their atmospheres,” Militzer told Salon. “Their magnetic fields are disordered and do not have the well-defined north and south poles that we know from Earth, Jupiter and Saturn. This has been a long-standing puzzle since the Voyager 2 spacecraft detected this in 1986.”\nThis explains why both Uranus and its solar system neighbor, Neptune, have magnetic fields very different from the one we experience on Earth.\n“Uranus and Neptune have disordered magnetic fields because they produce these fields in a thin water-rich layer in their mantles while our Earth generates its magnetic field in the core,” Militzer said.\nAs noted, it is extremely hard to make observations about Uranus because of its distance and the fact that we’ve only sent a probe to visit once. To make matters worse, it probably won't be until the 2040s before anything else we send there arrives. But that doesn’t mean scientists aren't making do with what they have, while revealing how truly weird this planetary system is.",

    "text": "Climate change denial is often seen as a mainstay of the political right, as leaders like President-elect Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson ignore or contradict the overwhelming scientific evidence that humans are cooking our only planet. It wasn’t always this way, of course — Republicans were once moderate stewards of the environment, with presidents like Richard Nixon passing progressive environmental laws. Now our global ecosystem crisis is often dismissed by conservatives as a “hoax” while we do nothing to stop drilling for oil or subsidizing fossil fuel companies.\nBut not everyone on the right denies climate change is a real and growing threat. Indeed, many people not only agree with the scientific consensus, they have used climate change as an excuse to push white supremacist ideologies and lash out against immigration. This phenomenon is far from new.\nExperts tell Salon that environmentalist politics and the politics of the far right have long intertwined, from eugenics and other pseudoscience of the early 20th century to white nationalism and fascism today.\nThe word “ecofascism” is used to describe these movements, although all of the scholars agree that it should be employed carefully. Few people explicitly call themselves “ecofascist,” yet an umbrella term is useful when describing the ideologies of those who accept the basic facts of environmental science — namely, that human activity is capable of drastically altering the planet for the worse, at least in terms of our ability to inhabit it — and use those facts as the premise for radical right-wing political conclusions.\n“Different strands of neo-Malthusian and social Darwinian thinking have sought to incorporate environmental concerns, often by emphasizing logics of scarcity and competition,” William A. Callison, a lecturer in social studies at Harvard University and a member of the Zetkin Collective, a group of scholars and activists working on the political ecology of the far right, told Salon. Neo-Malthusian refers to the concepts of economist Thomas Malthus, who argued against human overpopulation in the 18th century; social Darwinism is a misapplication of biologist Charles Darwin’s evolutionary theory to validate conservative social hierarchies.\n“These logics oppose nations or peoples to a racialized threat — enemies from without or within — that are said to consume or despoil the resources that belong to the natives,” Callison added. Sometimes these arguments are presented through dog whistles, such as the 1968 essay by ecologist Garret Harden called \"The Tragedy of the Commons,\" which is taught in economics classes to explain the dangers of overconsumption of resources because it lacked explicit racism.\n“There are ways that the climate crisis can intensify these logics, even while drawing from climate denialist discourses,” Callison said.\nEven beloved historical figures succumbed to extreme right-wing conclusions. President Theodore Roosevelt was one of America’s most consequential progressive leaders, in no small part because of his vigorous support for conservation, including jumpstarting the national park system. Yet he also supported eugenics, or the pseudoscience of controlling human reproduction to ensure that genetic traits deemed desirable are passed on.\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter Lab Notes.\nIn some ways, Roosevelt was a product of his time. The early 20th century more broadly was the heyday of ecofascism, with fascists in Europe embracing the ideas of Malthus and Darwin to argue that supposedly “inferior” races (Jews, Africans, Romani, Slavs and many others) deserved to be oppressed, even exterminated. According to Alexander Menrisky, an assistant professor of English at the University of Connecticut who has written about the intersection of environmentalism and fascism, the marriage of American conservationist movements with eugenics led to the passage of at least three racially motivated immigration-restriction bills.\n“The association between eugenics and early U.S. environmentalism isn't as strange as it might seem at a glance,” Menrisky said, referring to the popularity of the 1916 eugenics tome “The Passing of the Great Race” by anthropologist Madison Grant. It proved to be “one of the fountainheads of what is today called ‘replacement theory,’ or the notion that non-white peoples (and liberal governments) are actively conspiring to replace white populations.”\nFrom here, one can draw a direct connection between the environmentalism-cum-xenophobia of these early 20th century eugenicists and modern ecofascism. Some extremists on the right have gone on shooting sprees targeting certain minority people and will link their concerns about immigration to a belief that they are protecting the environment. This was the case for the white nationalist killers of Muslims in Christchurch, New Zealand; Latinos in El Paso, Texas; Jews in Pittsburgh; and socialists in Norway. After a 2022 massacre in Buffalo, New York targeting a predominantly Black supermarket, killing 10 people and wounding three others, authorities found a manifesto ranting that “white birth rates must change” and that the \"natural environment\" has become \"industrialized, pulverized and commoditized.\" Cribbing from the Christchurch manifesto, the shooter says “there is no conservatism without nature, there is no nationalism without environmentalism … The protection and preservation of these lands is of the same importance as the protection and preservation of our own ideals and beliefs.\"\nThe El Paso shooter, Patrick Crusius, expressed similar views in his own screed. Dubbing it “An Inconvenient Truth” in a seeming nod to Vice President Al Gore’s classic 2006 documentary about climate change, Crusius said that “water sheds around the country, especially in agricultural areas, are being depleted.” He argued new immigrants would only consume more, worsening Americans’ standard of living and environmental conditions. “Urban sprawl creates inefficient cities which unnecessarily destroys millions of acres of land,” he continued. “If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable.”\nThe Great Replacement Theory has been endorsed by Elon Musk, Trump and other conservatives from former Fox News pundits to members of Congress. These ideologies are helped by generous funding from industries which benefit from their spread. The fossil fuel industry, for example, has a history of promoting climate change denial while proposing solutions to climate change that do not involve phasing out fossil fuels. Daniele Conversi, a political historian and social theorist at the University of the Basque Country who has studied ecofascism, underscored how these wealthy special interests and their ideologies pose a major threat by obscuring uncomfortable scientific truths and channeling popular attention elsewhere.\n“For instance, Trumpism has substantially contributed to spreading a dangerous lack of trust not only in science and political institutions but in human achievements in general,” Conversi said, “And all of this, while identifying easy targets who are not responsible for the coming catastrophe.”\nIn fact, instead of referring to the modern movement as “ecofascism,” Conversi prefers the term “fossil fascism.”\n“As the far-right has a lot to gain from the loss and suffering of others, Trump-style forms of ‘fossil fascism’ are rapidly emerging as a mixture of ultranationalism, deception, disinformation, repeated lies, othering and eventually warmongering — all of which has characterized fascism throughout history,” Conversi said. That term describes the true inner dynamics of the fascist movement that wears the clothing of environmentalism among the far right.\n“Ecofascism is a neoliberal and far-right meme that has experienced a revival in the blogosphere and other forms of writing, but not so much in real politics,” Conversi said. “It is not historically or empirically grounded, as the environmental components of fascism were quite limited.”\nFor his part, Callison views the modern fascists as reincarnations of their Nazi counterparts from nearly a century prior.\n“The threats of this ideology can be seen in how Nazism made ecofascism an official part of its program,” Callison said. “In fact, it was the first regime to pass a Klimaschutz (climate protection) law, which is now a dominant and rather neutral frame in German environmental discourse. Ecofascism centered on the Blut and Boden — blood and soil — as constitutive of Germanness.” He added that “many far-right parties use this nationalist equation of culture and nature to gain popularity. Marine Le Pen is a prime example in France, Tucker Carlson in the United States. The claim is that migrants or foreign species do not value the environment, and thus pollute and consume it at the expense of natives.”\nImportantly, these modern ideologies — ecofascist or fossil fascist — have never been effective at actually addressing the environmental issues their adherents claim to value. Take El Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele, who has been accused of flirting with fascism. Bukele promised to strengthen environmental regulations when taking office in 2019, but has instead gutted the nation’s environmental agencies to the point of virtual non-existence.  Elon Musk, who has been tapped by Trump as one of his top economic advisers, has also suggested similar policies for the United States. By contrast another Musk ally, Argentina’s president Javier Milei, has always been openly anti-environmentalist, which is convenient for Musk as his company Tesla relies on Argentina’s mines for lithium.\n“The ideology has not yet been important in addressing climate change,” Callison said. “But it has been an important way for some European far-right parties to gain ground, and an alternative form of ‘greenwashing’ — gesturing at environmental concerns while distracting from the real sources and solutions to the climate crisis.”\nEcofascism may sound appealing, at least on a superficial level, for people who are sincerely interested in protecting the planet. Yet the existential crises facing our species — climate change, plastic pollution, the eradication of species — can only be solved through realistic solutions, like reducing emissions and protecting old growth forests. “Green” movements that purport to fight address these issues but ignore the science to attack marginalized, often poor communities are just as much a threat to humanity as rising temperatures.",

    "text": "2024 was an ominous year for the future of Earth. Climate scientists anticipate that it will be the first year in which the average planetary temperature was 1.5 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels, a critical threshold established in 2015 during the Paris climate accord. Meanwhile a 2023 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found humans brought about as many extinctions over the previous five centuries that if our species had never existed, it would have taken 18,000 years for that same number of genera to have gone extinct on their own.\nThe good news for humanity is that people have the power to stop these mass extinctions and stave off the worst consequences of climate change. The bad news for our species is that we are not doing any of those things; in fact, we are led by science-denying politicians like Donald Trump in the United States, Vladimir Putin in Russia, Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Javier Milei in Argentina.\nJulian Cribb, a British-Australian author who specializes in covering the intersections between science and politics, has published nine books on subjects related to ecocide — the practice in which humans actively destroy their environment. His latest is \"How to Fix a Broken Planet: Advice for Surviving the 21st Century,\" in which he warns that humanity is running out of time to fix the escalating crisis. Among other things, Cribb proposes the creation of a Global Truth Commission to help leaders separate good science and information from bad; technological innovation to wean humanity off of agriculture and create food in more sustainable ways; and strategies that will address all of the threats to humanity’s future holistically, rather than separately. Cribb discussed his thoughts on humanity’s future with Salon.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity and context.\nIn the past, you have advocated for a Global Truth Commission. Can you elaborate on what that means, how it would be implemented, and what you'll say to those who claim this violates free speech principles?\nA Global Truth Commission basically is a fact-checking agency. The world has 420 fact checking agencies, which are run mostly by media organizations, like Reuters, for example. In Australia, we have one run by the ABC, a fact-checking organization that simply checks the statements of public figures. If they find them to be false or untruthful or misleading, they publish their findings. They don't punish people in any way. They just simply expose the lies for what they are.\nAn Indian farmer checks his wheat crop that was damaged in heavy rain on the outskirts of Amritsar on March 21, 2018. (NARINDER NANU/AFP via Getty Images)And we believe now that, such as the torrent of untruths and deception of lies that are pouring forth from politicians, corporate interests and others, we have to make some corrections. Otherwise, you cannot have a democracy. You cannot even have a society if nobody knows what the truth is, because everything begins to disintegrate. Every decision you take is based on false grounds if you allow untruths to rage unchecked. So a World Truth Commission is simply a fact-checking agency that would check the statements of prominent public figures and publish its findings.\nHow do you deal with the fact that with climate change, pesticide pollution, plastic pollution and all of these ecocidal practices, there is so much misinformation that people can't distinguish between what is real and what is fake? How do you specifically make it easier for scientific facts to be widely distributed?\nThe Council for the Human Future is trying to do just that. We're about to set up a world news website where we will only publish scientifically validated, fact-checked information about these things. People are going to have to learn that if they accept false information, they are likely to incur damage to themselves. That's the penalty of accepting lies. People who believe them end up making bad decisions.\nYou can't thrust this on 8.2 billion people, but you can offer them the truth. You can offer them validated truths. In other words, things that have been checked by experts and, and not just asserted by vested interests in business, in commerce, in politics, and so on.\nBased on your research into effective political activism, what can individuals who are concerned about climate change do to empower themselves in meaningful ways?\nThe first thing is to understand that climate change is not the only threat. There are 10 major catastrophic threats to the human future. And they're all working together. They're all coming together at the one time. Climate change is only one of them. So it's only 10% of the problem we have to understand.\nThe others include resource failure or insecurity — i.e., lack of water and forests and fish and things like that; lack of food; collapse of ecosystems and mass extinction; nuclear weapons, WMDs and things like that; food security/food instability in the global food supply, which is now a major issue worldwide; pandemic diseases, which are breaking out every two or three years now; overpopulation, which occurs whenever you breach environmental boundaries; new technologies, every new technology starts off benign and then becomes malignant very, very rapidly, such as coal being benign in the 1850s, and it's become malignant, or AI, or nanotechnology, or biotechnology — these are all in danger of becoming malignant because they're uncontrolled, and we need control over new technologies; and basically misinformation is a major threat to human survival because people are not being informed about what the real situation is.\nA view of dried soil after the rising temperatures attributed to climate change have resulted in a reduction of water levels in wells and reservoirs across Sanaa, Yemen on August 26, 2023. (Mohammed Hamoud/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Why do you think, when people talk about ecocide, we only discuss climate change? Why do we not talk about this more broadly?\nBecause climate change has had huge scientific effort put into it, and consequently, its publicity has raised its profile above the other major threats. But ecological collapse and extinction are far more dangerous to the human future in the long run. We can't survive on a planet that cannot support life. We're destroying life left, right and center at the moment with global poisoning and the like.\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter Lab Notes.\nBasically ecocide is human overpopulation. Overpopulation is scientifically defined as a state where you start destroying your living environment. Whether you are a grasshopper or a bird or a human, if you start destroying the environment in which you live, then you are overpopulated. That's how we measure overpopulation. And the human species is way overpopulated, about four times overpopulated now. It's not just a number, it's not just about what is the ideal population of the planet, it's about how many people can actually survive here in the long run on the resources which are finite and provided by the Earth. So ecocide is just a kind of a lawyer's term for killing off the cradle of life that supports us.\nAre we doomed to be poisoned by pollution or can we still clean the planet?\nEvery breath you take, you are inhaling toxic chemicals. Whether it's from the rear end of a truck or a bus, or whether it's just coming out of your sofa or all those PFAS chemicals, flame retardants and stuff. Every child born today is born with toxic chemicals in its blood. It takes it in through its mother's milk. It gets a mouthful of pesticide. That’s World Health Organization data, not mine. We are completely surrounded by toxic chemistry.\nA lot of it is man-made and a lot of it is man-generated. In other words, actions like mining development, agriculture and so on, unleash a whole lot of chemicals which impinge on us every day. We get them through our mouths, through our skin and in our bones, by breathing. Every person on the planet is being poisoned every second of the day.\nIt seems like the answer is yes. Are there solutions to this?\nWe can fix them if we understand the problem. At the moment, we're only understanding bits of the problem. We're obsessed with plastics over here, and we're obsessed with hormone disruptors over there. We're looking at little bits of the problem. We're obsessed with PFAS chemicals. They're tiny. There's 350,000 manmade chemicals, right? And they all break down to make other chemicals and intermix with other chemicals.\nSo it's a very complex issue, but there are things we can do to clean up the planet, yes. It's a major problem. It's five times larger than climate change. It kills 10 times more people than climate change, but there are solutions to it, and I've published them in a couple of books.\nIn some of your books, you made the link between climate change and these other forms of pollution, but also how they are linked to issues like famine and war.\nThe way most people are going to feel climate change is in the failure of the food supply, because clearly famine is spreading around the world at the moment. Food price inflation is going through the roof. It's what destabilized America enough for the Trump regime to get in. Trump is a climate impact, believe it or not. Trump is a climate impact, an impact of climate change, because when people get nervous about food availability, the price of food, they tend to vote for authoritarian conservative or right-wing regimes. And that's what's happening worldwide. It's not just in America. It's happening in Australia, it's happening in Austria, it's happening in Hungary — it's everywhere. The world is swinging to the right because of this uncertainty generated by the climate impact on food.\nThere are many ways that climate impacts food.It creates drought, obviously, and that cuts crop harvest yields. It produces heat waves, which often prevent the flowering of the crops, so that destroys their fertility. Rice, for example, will not grow above 42.2 degrees Celsius. The rice plant dies, so you could lose your rice harvest in a certain area. Things like that and floods will also destroy crops. It’s a big problem.\nAgriculture was a beautiful technology for 7,000 years back in the Bronze Age. It is not appropriate to feed 10 billion people on a hot, climate-ravaged earth. We need new ways to produce food, and there are new ways to produce food, and they're being experimented all around the world at the moment.\nClimate change is also fueling immigration. How do you propose we handle this?\nIt's very, very hard to control. I read a report from the Swiss in Zurich predicting 1.2 billion climate refugees by 2050. That's terrifying. The number's about a hundred million at the moment. There's about 350 million humans on the move worldwide now every year. But Zurich is talking about a tripling or a quadruple in the number of human beings on the move that is going to collapse borders. It's going to sweep away governments completely. It's going to utterly destroy the old nation-states as we know them.\nFor example, if a hundred million refugees come out of Africa and flood into Europe, you are going to lose Spain, Italy and Greece just like that. Their people in turn will flee north into the other countries. You get this displacement effect. It is actually a realistic fear. The only way to keep people in their own countries is to secure their food supply. To do that, you need renewable food and you need to recycle your water.\nCan you elaborate on the technology that would provide this renewable food and clean water?\nWith water, it is simply a matter of recycling. You just use well-established scientific techniques to cleanse the water that you are currently flushing down the toilet or running off the city streets and you remove the bugs from it and put it back into the system with food.\nThere are three main ways of producing renewable food: One is regenerative farming, which is being practiced by advanced farmers around the world; the second one is recycling all of the nutrients and all the water that currently flow through our big cities, enabling cities like New York or Shanghai or Paris to feed themselves by simply recycling nutrients and growing their own food on the spot with the nutrients and water that they've already got using hydroponic, aquaponic and other systems; and the third one is deep ocean aquaculture, which is being pursued by scientists at Berkeley University of California at Berkeley.\nIt's a very feasible technology for producing an endless supply of food from the deep oceans, not from the coast. I hasten to add, it's not a form of farming. You use the deep water where you're not impacting any other species around the planet. You're not displacing anything else. You're not cutting down the Amazon in order to feed people. These three systems will create a renewable food supply.\nMy next question is in one of your books, you mentioned that women would be better to lead on climate change than men. What does smashing the patriarchy, so to speak, have to do with climate change?\nIn all my reading of history, I've never found a woman who started a war. I don't mean Helen of Troy-type mythology. Women have led countries successfully in defense of their own country, people like Golda Meir in Israel and Indira Gandhi in India and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom. They've defended their country successfully against aggression, male aggression from elsewhere. But in the last 150 years, all wars that have been started, they've all been started by males, either male-dominated governments or kings, basically. Wars of conquest, which are normally fought over territory, food, land and water are things that blokes like doing.\nA protester is walking towards a wildfire started by a launched tear gas canister during a march as part of a rally against the construction of a giant water reservoir (mega-bassine) in Migne-Auxances, western France, on July 19, 2024. (Jerome Gilles/NurPhoto via Getty Images)What do you think of the results of the 2024 election in which a candidate who acknowledges science was a woman and lost to a candidate who does not acknowledge science and is a man?\nThat was partly the result of misinformation, which we discussed earlier, but also as I mentioned, climate is already driving up inflation and it's making the food supply less secure. There is drought all through America at the moment. People are feeling very nervous. Now, to give you an example, in the 1930s, Germany had been through a horrendous famine and starvation in World War I, when nearly a million Germans died of hunger. That was what drove Germany into the arms of the National Socialists. Basically, this insecurity regarding food and inflation, a massive inflation under the Weimar Republic, shook people to the core. So basically that's what makes people nervous and they tend to go for big, tough authoritarian male leaders. And I think that's what, from my reading of all the American commentary, it was basically economic insecurity that delivered Trump the win.\nBut of course, he's already appointing a cabinet of the cognitively impaired, people who simply do not understand the problem or else are hostile to objective information. You're going to get some very bad decisions in the next four years, and America's going to be a very unpleasant place to live for ordinary, decent human beings. A lot of the ugly aspects of authoritarian rule are probably going to become manifest. So you have my heartfelt sympathies, but it's going to happen in a lot of other countries, not just America. It's happening in Britain. It's happening in Australia. It's a pretty universal trend at the moment, and it's not going to save us. It’s going to speed our demise.",

    "text": "The bones they found in the sand were a clue that something more was buried beneath the surface. When a team of excavators in the Turkana Basin, an archaeological site in Kenya, dug deeper, they found more evidence that ancient human ancestors had existed in the region: footprints.\n“One long trail was super obvious and really spectacular,” said Craig Feibel, a geographer at Rutgers University who was called in to study the site.\nArchaeologists had been able to determine that two different kinds of hominins, or living beings that evolved after the split from the apes 6 or 7 million years ago, existed near this ancient lake in Kenya at the same time based on bones that had been discovered in the region. But these remarkably preserved footprints were the first to indicate that two different species of hominins — including Homo erectus, which is a direct ancestor to humans, and Paranthropus boisei, which was a different species that also descended from the ape ancestor but died off around 1 million years ago. Both coexisted around 1.5 million years ago in this space, Feibel said.\nIn fact, the footprints indicate these two species were walking along the lakeshore within hours or days of each other, according to a study published this week in Science that Feibel co-authored.\n“You can never tie down where bones come from [because] they could be transported or carried off by carnivores or scavengers,” Feibel told Salon in a phone interview. “With the footprints, we know these two species were right here on the same beach within a short period of time.”\nA 3D computerized model of the surface of the area near Lake Turkana in Kenya shows fossil footprints of Paranthropus boisei (vertical footprints) with separate footprints of Homo erectus forming a perpendicular path. (Kevin Hatala/Chatham University)Over time, sediment accumulated on the lakeshore and the footprints were preserved underground. In the past half a million years, activity in the Rift Valley has pushed up these layers of sediment with the footprints, exposing this fossil evidence, Feibel said.\nIn addition to these two species of hominins, researchers in the region have also found evidence of ancestors of animals still found in Africa today like giraffes, pigs, and elephants. The researchers in this study also found large footprints from a bird, likely from the giant marabou stork lineage, according to the study.\n“The lake margin is a really rich environment, so there would potentially be aquatic resources like fish available there,” Feibel said. “It would have also been near an extensive grassland with lots of available plant resources and lots of animals that are using those resources coming down to the lake for water.”\nGenerally, our direct ancestors Homo erectus are thought to have used tools and eaten meat, whereas P. boisei, an evolutionary cousin, had larger jaws that are thought to have been used to chew mainly vegetation. Both were walking on two feet, although they had different gaits and foot shapes, which the research team in this study used to differentiate the footprints.\nThere’s no way to know for sure what relationship these two species of hominins had with one another, but they likely coexisted because they had different diets and possibly habitat preferences, said Matthew Sponheimer, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado Boulder.\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter Lab Notes.\n“If Homo erectus ate considerably more animal foods than Paranthropus boisei, that alone would guarantee rather different niches,” Sponheimer told Salon in a phone interview. “We have very little reason, given our current knowledge of the diets of these species, to think there would have been much competition.”\nFootprints can help us better understand how various ancient species moved about in a way that sedentary bones cannot, Sponheimer said. In northern Tanzania, footprints helped anthropologists understand that other hominin species also coexisted near the famous human ancestor “Lucy,” a species known as Australopithecus afarensis, dating back roughly 3 million years ago.\nFootprints can also tell us more about the portions of the landscape that were frequented by these hominins. For example, there is some debate about whether the large jaws of P. boisei were used to crack hard foods like nuts or simply chow down on plants. Discovering more footprints in the region to get a better idea of how this species was moving around the lake could help determine if they ate mostly plants or consumed other foods as well.\n“That our fossil ancestors and close kin needed water in itself is not shocking … But one of the best ways to get sufficient calories given Paranthropus boisei’s chewing anatomy would be to eat plants near water,” Sponheimer said. “So it would be lovely if we had an independent line of evidence that is consistent with a lot of this new dietary evidence we have.”\nResearchers have been studying this region for decades and continue to find new fossil evidence, Feibel said. As these excavators continue to search for other ancient remnants, they will likely be spending hours pacing along the same shore the hominins before them did 1.5 million years ago.\n“Footprints give more detail than these discrete bits of anatomy that we typically have,” Sponheimer said. “And it just hits you differently visually when you see those footprints — just as if you were walking in the sand at the beach.”",

    "title": "TV’s Dr. Oz invested in businesses regulated by agency Trump wants him to lead",
    "author": "Darius Tahir",
    "date": "November 30, 2",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to run the sprawling government agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act marketplace — celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz — recently held broad investments in health care, tech, and food companies that would pose significant conflicts of interest.\nOz’s holdings, some shared with family, included a stake in UnitedHealth Group worth as much as $600,000, as well as shares of pharmaceutical firms and tech companies with business in the health care sector, such as Amazon. Collectively, Oz’s investments total tens of millions of dollars, according to financial disclosures he filed during his failed 2022 run for a Pennsylvania U.S. Senate seat.\nTrump said Tuesday he would nominate Oz as administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The agency’s scope is huge: CMS oversees coverage for more than 160 million Americans, nearly half the population. Medicare alone accounts for approximately $1 trillion in annual spending, with over 67 million enrollees.\nUnitedHealth Group is one of the largest health care companies in the nation and arguably the most important business partner of CMS, through which it is the leading provider of commercial health plans available to Medicare beneficiaries.\nUnitedHealth also offers managed-care plans under Medicaid, the joint state-federal program for low-income people, and sells plans on government-run marketplaces set up via the Affordable Care Act. Oz also had smaller stakes in CVS Health, which now includes the insurer Aetna, and in the insurer Cigna.\nIt’s not clear if Oz, a heart surgeon by training, still holds investments in health care companies, or if he would divest his shares or otherwise seek to mitigate conflicts of interest should he be confirmed by the Senate. Reached by phone on Wednesday, he said he was in a Zoom meeting and declined to comment. An assistant did not reply to an email message with detailed questions.\n“It’s obvious that over the years he’s cultivated an interest in the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry,” said Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group. “That raises a question of whether he can be trusted to act on behalf of the American people.” (The publisher of KFF Health News, David Rousseau, is on the CSPI board.)\nOz used his TikTok page on multiple occasions in November to praise Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including their efforts to take on the “illness-industrial complex,” and he slammed “so-called experts like the big medical societies” for dishing out what he called bad nutritional advice. Oz’s positions on health policy have been chameleonic; in 2010, he cut an ad urging Californians to sign up for insurance under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, telling viewers they had a “historic opportunity.”\nOz’s 2022 financial disclosures show that the television star invested a substantial part of his wealth in health care and food firms. Were he confirmed to run CMS, his job would involve interacting with giants of the industry that have contributed to his wealth.\nGiven the breadth of his investments, it would be difficult for Oz to recuse himself from matters affecting his assets, if he still holds them. “He could spend his time in a rocking chair” if that happened, Lurie said.\nIn the past, nominees for government positions with similar potential conflicts of interest have chosen to sell the assets or otherwise divest themselves. For instance, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Attorney General Merrick Garland agreed to divest their holdings in relevant, publicly traded companies when they joined the Biden administration.\nTrump, however, declined in his first term to relinquish control of his own companies and other assets while in office, and he isn’t expected to do so in his second term. He has not publicly indicated concern about his subordinates’ financial holdings.\nCMS’ main job is to administer Medicare. About half of new enrollees now choose Medicare Advantage, in which commercial insurers provide their health coverage, instead of the traditional, government-run program, according to an analysis from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.\nProponents of Medicare Advantage say the private plans offer more compelling services than the government and better manage the costs of care. Critics note that Medicare Advantage plans have a long history of costing taxpayers more than the traditional program.\nUnitedHealth, CVS, and Cigna are all substantial players in the Medicare Advantage market. It’s not always a good relationship with the government. The Department of Justice filed a 2017 complaint against UnitedHealth alleging the company used false information to inflate charges to the government. The case is ongoing.\nOz is an enthusiastic proponent of Medicare Advantage. In 2020, he proposed offering Medicare Advantage to all; during his Senate run, he offered a more general pledge to expand those plans. After Trump announced Oz’s nomination for CMS, Jeffrey Singer, a senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, said he was “uncertain about Dr. Oz’s familiarity with health care financing and economics.”\nSinger said Oz’s Medicare Advantage proposal could require large new taxes — perhaps a 20% payroll tax — to implement.\nOz has gotten a mixed reception from elsewhere in Washington. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, the Democrat who defeated Oz in 2022, signaled he’d potentially support his appointment to CMS. “If Dr. Oz is about protecting and preserving Medicare and Medicaid, I’m voting for the dude,” he said on the social platform X.\nOz’s investments in companies doing business with the federal government don’t end with big insurers. He and his family also hold hospital stocks, according to his 2022 disclosure, as well as a stake in Amazon worth as much as nearly $2.4 million. (Candidates for federal office are required to disclose a broad range of values for their holdings, not a specific figure.)\nAmazon operates an internet pharmacy, and the company announced in June that its subscription service is available to Medicare enrollees. It also owns a primary care service, One Medical, that accepts Medicare and “select” Medicare Advantage plans.\nOz was also directly invested in several large pharmaceutical companies and, through investments in venture capital funds, indirectly invested in other biotech and vaccine firms. Big Pharma has been a frequent target of criticism and sometimes conspiracy theories from Trump and his allies. Kennedy, whom Trump has said he’ll nominate to be Health and Human Services secretary, is a longtime anti-vaccine activist.\nDuring the Biden administration, Congress gave Medicare authority to negotiate with drug companies over their prices. CMS initially selected 10 drugs. Those drugs collectively accounted for $50.5 billion in spending between June 1, 2022, and May 31, 2023, under Medicare’s Part D prescription drug benefit.\nAt least four of those 10 medications are manufactured by companies in which Oz held stock, worth as much as about $50,000.\nOz may gain or lose financially from other Trump administration proposals.\nFor example, as of 2022, Oz held investments worth as much as $6 million in fertility treatment providers. To counter fears that politicians who oppose abortion would ban in vitro fertilization, Trump floated during his campaign making in vitro fertilization treatment free. It’s unclear whether the government would pay for the services.\nIn his TikTok videos from earlier in November, Oz echoed attacks on the food industry by Kennedy and other figures in his “Make America Healthy Again” movement. They blame processed foods and underregulation of the industry for the poor health of many Americans, concerns shared by many Democrats and more mainstream experts.\nBut in 2022, Oz owned stakes worth as much as $80,000 in Domino’s Pizza, Pepsi, and US Foods, as well as more substantial investments in other parts of the food chain, including cattle; Oz reported investments worth as much as $5.5 million in a farm and livestock, as well as a stake in a dairy-free milk startup. He was also indirectly invested in the restaurant chain Epic Burger.\nOne of his largest investments was in the Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain Wawa, which sells fast food and all manner of ultra-processed snacks. Oz and his wife reported a stake in the company, beloved by many Pennsylvanians, worth as much as $30 million.\nKFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF—an independent source of health policy research, polling, and journalism.

    "title": "\"Corporate abuse\": Kroger and Albertsons are in hot water over alleged strike sabotage",
    "author": "Ashlie D. Stevens",
    "date": "December 2, 20",
    "text": "Supermarket chains Kroger and Albertsons, already under scrutiny for their proposed $24.6 billion merger, are now facing a new class-action lawsuit that alleges the companies conspired against unionized workers during a 2022 strike. The suit, which was filed in Colorado, accuses the companies of entering a “no-poach” agreement which illegally undermined workers’ bargaining power.\nThe lead plaintiff, Valarie Morgan, is a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 who led King Soopers contract negotiations from 2021 to 2022. She and the other grocery workers who claim they are similarly affected are represented by the progressive legal nonprofit, Towards Justice. Morgan claims the companies colluded to prevent Albertsons, which owns Safeway stores in Colorado, from hiring workers striking against King Soopers, which is a Kroger subsidiary.\n“I want to stand up for all the workers who were harmed by this corporate abuse,” Morgan said in a statement. “These companies rigged the system against us, undermining our right to fight for better pay and fair treatment through our unions.”\nIn 2022, more than 8,000 King Soopers employees walked off the job as they demanded higher wages and improved working conditions. The strike ended with a new contract, but the new lawsuit contends the alleged no-poach agreement limited employees’ leverage and cost workers potential gains during bargaining. According to The Denver Post, Morgan’s lawsuit targets “the same alleged ‘no-poach’ deal that Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said Kroger and Albertsons Cos. agreed to when members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 went on strike against King Soopers.”\nWeiser’s lawsuit — which was filed in February and sought to block the merger between Kroger and Albertsons — alleges that emails between senior labor executives at both companies, disclosed during the inquiry, revealed that an Albertsons executive promised not to hire striking King Soopers workers or solicit their pharmacy customers, violating the state’s antitrust laws.\nAccording to the Denver Post, the complaint about the agreements is independent of the merger.“But the fact that the company entered into such agreements and thought they could get away with it, underscores why competition matters, to consumers, to workers, to farmers and to our communities,” Weiser said.\nAt the time, Kroger’s legal team rejected claims that the correspondence constitutes unlawful agreement. During the Colorado trial, as reported by Colorado Newsline, a lawyer for Kroger argued the companies were not engaging in a “quid pro quo,” but only sought to understand each other’s intent.\n“That’s all my client did — asked Albertsons, ‘This is what your folks are doing. This is what our folks are doing. What is your intent?’” said Kroger attorney Matt Wolf. “That is not an unlawful question. Responding to that question is not unlawful. That is not an agreement.”\nIn a statement sent to Salon via email, a Kroger spokesperson said of the lawsuits: “There were no non-solicitation or so-called no-poach agreements between Kroger and Albertsons. Kroger competes for talent in a broad and diverse labor market, including from non-grocery, non-union retailers like restaurants, food service companies, conveniences, warehouses and more. In fact, data shows that only 1 [to] 2.5% of Kroger associates come from and/or move to Albertsons.”\nHowever, union officials see it differently. Kim Cordova, the president of the UFCW Local 7, said the group’s members “could have made even more gains if these corporations had not broken the law behind our backs.”\n“Had we known the companies were working in tandem, in a coordinated effort to hurt the members, we believe the outcome would have been different,” Cordova told the Denver Post.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Colorado state court, seeks financial compensation for lost wages and an injunction to prevent similar agreements in the future. It also claims the companies’ actions violated Colorado’s antitrust laws, which prohibit agreements that restrain competition.\nThis latest controversy adds fuel to the ongoing debate surrounding Kroger and Albertsons’ proposed merger, which has drawn opposition from labor groups, consumer advocates and government regulators. Critics of the deal argue that combining two of the largest grocery chains in the country could stifle competition, which might lead to higher prices for customers and layoffs and worsened conditions for workers.\nThe Federal Trade Commission has filed its own lawsuit to block the merger, citing antitrust concerns. The agency argues that the deal would reduce competition and lead to price increases for consumers.\nTo address regulatory concerns, Kroger and Albertsons have proposed divesting hundreds of stores, particularly in regions where their operations overlap. Earlier this year, the companies announced plans to sell Safeway locations in Arizona and other areas.\nAlbertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran has defended the merger as a strategic necessity to compete with non-union retail giants like Walmart, Amazon and Costco. “I have deep concerns when I look forward about our competitive condition,” Sankaran said earlier this year. “If you don’t fundamentally change your competitive condition as you look out two, three, four years, your financial condition will deteriorate. I’m losing more of our customers’ dollars to Costco and Walmart than to Kroger.”\nHowever, labor leaders argue that such corporate moves prioritize profits over people.\n“Coloradans remember the King Soopers strike well. Many of us refused to cross the picket line to support workers’ right to fair wages,” David Seligman, executive director of Towards Justice, said in a statement. “Little did we know that these companies had worked behind the scenes to rig the game. Their illegal scheme hurt workers, consumers, and the broader community. That’s what this case is about.”\nAs the lawsuit unfolds, it underscores broader tensions in the grocery industry over labor rights and market consolidation. For workers like Morgan, the fight is about more than wages; it’s about accountability.\n“Hardworking Coloradans deserve better,” she said.\nUPDATE: This story has been updated to include a statement from Kroger.\n",

    "title": "Gratitude changed how I cooked this year",
    "author": "Ashlie D. Stevens",
    "date": "November 28, 2",
    "text": "For much of my life, the concept of gratitude has felt like a well-intentioned holiday guest who overstayed their welcome. A nice enough idea, sure, but one that began to feel suffocating in its endless repetitions and increasingly strange associations. These days, “practicing gratitude” seems to come bundled with jade rollers, superfoods and the kind of journals that include prompts like “What’s your vibration today?” The wellness industry got its hands on gratitude and, inevitably, made it sticky with self-help slogans.\nTo be fair, though, I was a little suspicious of the concept long before it got Goop-ified. Growing up in a deeply Evangelical church, gratitude was often framed less as a virtue and more as a preemptive apology to an easily angered God. Be thankful, I was told, for your blessings — because if you’re not, He’ll know. It’s hard to feel a warm glow of appreciation when it comes with a side of cosmic guilt and the threat of eternal damnation.\nBut after my 30th birthday — and surviving a global pandemic in which the sheer magnitude of international loss seemed to magnify personal sorrows  — I found myself cautiously circling back to gratitude. It started with a desire to reconnect with God, though this time, I left organized religion out of it. Gratitude seemed like a low-stakes way to restart the conversation: a quiet thank-you here and there, no strings attached.\nAt first, I stuck to the big stuff: my family, my partner, my friends. Then, my thank-yous got smaller, almost embarrassingly so. The crunch of fall leaves on my daily walk. How the really good cinnamon I splurged on enhances my morning latte. The way my dachshund, unabashedly ridiculous, rolls belly-up on the scratchy hallway carpet each morning. I worried for a bit that I was becoming a slightly self-involved dork, the sort of person who might, in earnest, Instagram a gratitude list. But over time, I stopped caring.\nGratitude’s real breakthrough came in the kitchen. As someone who writes about food and spends an unreasonable amount of my free time thinking about what to eat next, I began to see cooking through this recalibrated lens. Leftovers, once a source of mild dread, transformed into opportunities. A container of roasted vegetables wasn’t just Tuesday’s dinner; it was Wednesday’s frittata. Half a stale baguette wasn’t trash; it was bread pudding or croutons or something I could blitz into breadcrumbs. The kitchen became less of a battleground for my expectations and more of a playground for my experiments.\nEven grocery shopping changed. Instead of rushing through the store, I started lingering—yes, lingering!—in the produce section, marveling at the deep purple of a perfectly ripe plum or the scent of fresh dill. I noticed the weight of a good lemon in my hand, the neat rows of spices on the shelves. What once felt like drudgery became a small but significant ritual of abundance.\nThe biggest shift, though, was in the act of cooking itself. For quite a while, it had felt like an obligation: something to fit between deadlines and dishes, a chore to be completed before collapsing on the couch, which I recognize is ironic for someone who works in food media. But with gratitude in the mix, cooking became something else entirely. I remembered how much I loved the small, sensory details: the hiss of olive oil in a pan, the way garlic perfumes the air, the tactile pleasure of kneading dough. Recipes became invitations rather than instructions, and mistakes — an over-salted soup, a lopsided pie crust — became part of the joy.\nNot every meal was a triumph, of course. There were nights when I reverted to a bowl of cereal, eaten unceremoniously while standing over the sink. But even then, I’d find myself quietly thankful for the crispness of Cinnamon Toast Crunch or the convenience of boxed oat milk. Gratitude has a funny way of sneaking in, even when you’re not paying attention.\nI won’t pretend this shift was profound. Gratitude didn’t fundamentally alter my cooking so much as it reframed it. What was once a daily grind became a daily grace, an act of care for myself and the people I feed. Food became more than just fuel; it became a reminder of the extraordinary within the ordinary.\nGratitude remains an awkward, earnest thing. It’s a little embarrassing, like a parent waving too enthusiastically at a school play. But in learning to embrace that embarrassment, I’ve found something that feels surprisingly close to joy. And for that, I am thankful.",

    "text": "\nThanksgiving is a marvelous holiday—but not always for our wallets. This year, however, the financial stress (including lingering inflation) doesn’t have to break the bank.\nSalon spoke with financial, food and grocery experts to gather the best tips for a budget-friendly celebration.\nAnya Obrez, of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), suggests starting with portion planning. The NRDC’s free digital tool, the \"Guest-imator,\" can help estimate serving sizes. Obrez also advises shopping with a detailed list and sticking to it.\n“Making an apple pie? Skip the peeler,” Obrez said. “Those peels are nutrient-dense and taste great in pie! I like to keep a ‘stock bag’ in my freezer where I collect vegetable and meat trimmings to make stock.”\nFor post-shopping strategies, Obrez recommends serving smaller portions: “Start with a smaller plate. If anyone is still hungry after the first pass, they can always go back for seconds.” She also suggests encouraging guests to bring reusable containers for leftovers.\nSmart storage, she adds, can extend shelf life and reduce waste. Tools like the NRDC’s Save the Food storage guide can help, as can understanding date labels. “With the exception of infant formula, most of the date labels are generally indicators of when food will be at its peak quality and is still perfectly good to eat,” Obrez explained.\nWant more great food writing and recipes? Subscribe to Salon Food's newsletter, The Bite.\nDespite inflation, Thanksgiving may cost less this year, according to Dr. Michael Swanson, chief agriculture economist at the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute. In many categories, name-brand products are priced similarly — or even lower — than store brands, giving shoppers flexibility.\nSwanson suggests shopping early to take advantage of retailer deals, opting for store-brand stuffing, and taking advantage of stable year-over-year turkey prices. He also noted that cranberries are cheaper than last year.\nFor additional savings, consider a potluck-style dinner. “Have friends and family closest to retailers offering the best deals scoop up those items,” he said.\nSwanson also encouraged cooking from scratch when possible.\n“It’s always cheaper to go with foods that need a bigger investment of time,” he said. “A shopper who doesn’t want to go through the hassle of buying ingredients for a salad [might] go for a packaged mix, even if it’s more expensive – but they can then look other places to save on cost where they enjoy cooking from scratch.\"\nShoppers aren’t required to buy a whole turkey. If dark meat is your preference, turkey thighs and drumsticks are an option. If you love white meat, turkey breasts can suffice.\nJosh Kobert, senior content marketer at FinanceBuzz, noted that turkey prices vary widely based on factors like freshness and preparation style.\n“For the sake of consistency and accurate comparisons across stores, we limit our analysis to prices for a single style and brand of turkey, which is a whole frozen Butterball,” he said. “Butterball may be the biggest name in turkey, but they are by no means the only one and birds from other suppliers may be more or less expensive, depending on things like how the turkey was raised, how it was prepared and more.\"\nTurkey prices are down compared to 2022 and 2023, he said, thanks to lower feed costs and better industry planning following avian flu outbreaks in previous years.\nKobert’s top tip? Do your research. “With the rise of online shopping apps and websites it is incredibly easy to do comparison shopping from the comfort of your couch and find the best price for any and all side dishes or ingredients you may need for your Thanksgiving meal,” he said.\nNo matter your approach, here’s hoping your Thanksgiving is warm, celebratory, and — above all — thankful.",

    "text": "Back in October, Chipotle announced in its third-quarter earnings report that food, beverage and packaging costs went up from 29.7% to 30.6% of total revenue due to inflation. Now, the burrito chain may implement another price increase to offset the costs of raw ingredients that have been hit hard by inflation — like avocados, queso, and sour cream — according to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal.\n“With inflation for its ingredients in the low single digits, Chipotle executives are considering raising prices but want to maintain its appeal to consumers looking for deals and discounts,” the Journal’s Jennifer Williams wrote. Despite the higher menu prices, Chipotle will remain a more cost-effective option for customers compared to similar alternatives, Chipotle’s Chief Financial Officer Adam Rymer told the outlet.\nRymer, who was slated to become the company’s CFO in January, assumed his position three months earlier than anticipated due to former Chipotle Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol, who now leads Starbucks, leaving his position in August. Rymer succeeds longtime finance chief Jack Hartung, who is staying with the company indefinitely to help with management transitions, the Journal reported. Hartung currently serves as president of strategy, finance and supply chain.\nCompany executives have yet to decide when the price increases will take place, or how large the hikes will be. Rymer, however, described the potential price increases as “modest.”\nAnalysts are confident that the upcoming lift will not deter Chipotle consumers and negatively impact the chain’s business. David Tarantino, a senior analyst covering restaurants at Baird, told the Journal that there hasn’t been much customer resistance in response to Chipotle’s previous price increases. Between 2021 and early 2024, the chain has increased its prices six times. The latest price hike was in April and only affected California restaurants after the state’s $20 minimum wage mandate went into full effect.\nTarantino said another price increase “will likely be digestible.” That’s because Chipotle customers tend to be wealthier (Business Insider has described the chain as “a budget restaurant for rich people”) and more loyal to the chain. Additionally, the chain’s “menu items are a better overall value than other options,” Tarantino told the Journal.\n“Price increases are lagging what we’re seeing elsewhere, and that leads to a much stronger value proposition,” he said, citing Chipotle’s chicken burrito as an example. The price of the popular menu item has increased by 41% in the past decade, while overall restaurant prices increased 50%, per Tarantino’s research, the Journal wrote.\nWant more great food writing and recipes? Subscribe to Salon Food's newsletter, The Bite.\nChipotle’s decision to further hike up menu prices comes after the chain received countless online complaints targeting its inadequate portion sizes. Last month, Chipotle interim CEO Scott Boatwright said the company has since been serving “consistent and generous portions.”\n“We know that portioning is a core equity of ours in the organization,” Boatwright said. “We are committed to ensuring that we give the right portion to every guest that walks into the building.”\n“We’ve seen strong improvement, even through our social channels … Now it’s a reverse of what we saw earlier in the year, around people posting big burritos, big bowls, and really excited about portioning they’re getting in the Chipotle brand,” he added.",

Costco’s Kirkland brand eggs and a large batch of cucumbers are the latest items to face recalls due to potential salmonella contamination.\nAccording to Aimee Picchi of CBS News, “The Kirkland Signature Organic Pasture Raised 24-Count Eggs were sold at 25 Costco locations across several states.” The recall affects 10,800 packages of eggs from Handsome Brook Farm, distributed starting November 22, with a “use by” date of January 5, 2025.\nImpacted states include Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. No illnesses have been reported so far, but consumers are advised to discard or return the eggs for a refund.\nMeanwhile, Forbes reporter Mary Whitfill Roeloffs notes that SunFed has recalled whole cucumbers sold in more than two dozen states. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the outbreak has sickened 68 people in 19 states, with 18 requiring hospitalization. Montana reported the most cases at 16, followed by Oregon and Colorado, each with seven to nine cases. The Arizona-based company issued the recall after the FDA linked several illnesses to cucumbers sold between October 12 and November 26, 2024. Consumers should discard or return the cucumbers for a refund.\nAs holiday gatherings ramp up, shoppers should remain vigilant by checking food recall notices, especially when preparing meals for guests. Food recalls have become alarmingly frequent — staying informed can help ensure safety at the table.",

    "author": "Ashlie D. Stevens",
    "date": "December 1, 20",
    "text": "House wines have long been the underdog of drink menus—functional, affordable and often forgettable. But in the Bay Area, a new wave of partnerships between restaurants and local wineries is redefining what a house wine can be.\nBodega SF’s Jurassic Vineyard Riesling, crafted in collaboration with Comptoir Wine Co., offers a crisp, dry profile that perfectly complements the restaurant’s Vietnamese menu. Meanwhile, Flour + Water has teamed up with Subject to Change Wine Co. to create cheekily named blends like “Pasta Water” and “Pasta Sauce,” while Outta Sight has partnered with Deux Punx for a refreshing white wine blend.\nThese custom collaborations allow restaurants to celebrate their identities, showcase local terroirs and forge deeper connections with diners, all while encouraging an entire industry to rethink the potential of a good house wine.\nMatt Ho of Bodega SF spoke with Salon about his new offering, how it pairs with their signature dishes like Banh Khot Caviar and the process behind crafting a blend that tells its own story.\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nWhat inspired the partnership between Bodega SF and Comptoir Wine Co. to create the ‘Jurassic Vineyard’ Riesling?\nThe partnership between Bodega SF and Comptoir Wine Co. was sparked by a genuine connection. David had been a fan of the restaurant from the beginning, and over time, we developed a strong friendship. I liked his wines and added them to the list. He has since been helping us run the wine program. We fantasized about working together on something special for the restaurant and when we saw that Riesling was available at the vineyard, it felt like the perfect time to collaborate — especially with the restaurant approaching its second anniversary. The Jurassic Vineyard Riesling became a way to celebrate that milestone and bring something unique to our guests.\nHow does the unique profile of your house wine enhance the flavors of your Vietnamese menu offerings? Are there specific dishes that pair particularly well?\nOur Riesling is crafted to be on the drier side, with crisp acidity and bright citrus notes that pair perfectly with several dishes on our menu. One standout pairing is the Banh Khot Caviar; the caviar’s salinity complements the wine’s minerality, creating a balanced and refreshing contrast. Another favorite is the Whole Fish Cha Ca, where the wine’s dry citrus profile enhances the flavors in the marinade, bringing out the best in both the dish and the wine. These combinations showcase how the Riesling truly elevates our food, making it more than just another wine by the glass — it’s an integral part of the dining experience.\nCan you walk us through the process of creating a collaborative blend? What considerations do you and the winemaker discuss when crafting the wine?\nOur priority was ensuring the Riesling would pair seamlessly with our food. The first decision was whether to make it on the sweeter or drier side, and we ultimately chose a dry style to enhance our menu’s flavors. We also wanted the wine to showcase the unique qualities of the vineyard itself. Fortunately, David has a thoughtful and minimalist approach to winemaking, so we trusted him to guide us in bringing out the vineyard’s essence and creating a wine that feels distinctly ours.\nHow have your customers reacted to the house wine blend? Have you noticed any shifts in preferences or feedback compared to traditional house wines?\nGuests have been responding really well to the collaboration! Many are pleasantly surprised by its dryness, especially since Rieslings are often associated with sweetness. This unexpected twist has piqued interest, drawing in even those who might usually shy away from Rieslings. The dichotomy of citrus notes and minerality have been a standout feature, pairing seamlessly with our dishes and enhancing the dining experience. This shift has not only opened guests up to a different style of Riesling but also shown that a thoughtfully-chosen wine can change perceptions and create memorable pairings.\nDo you foresee more restaurants following your lead in creating custom house wine blends? What do you think this trend says about the evolving relationship between food and wine?\nAbsolutely. I see more restaurants embracing custom labels as part of their unique identity. The restaurant community thrives on collaboration and fostering connections, and creating a signature wine is a powerful way to do that.\nA custom blend lets us extend our brand beyond our walls and intrigue new guests who haven’t yet dined with us. It’s a natural extension of the evolving relationship between food and wine — one where both are seen as integral parts of a curated experience rather than standalone elements.\nThis trend highlights a shift toward deeper storytelling, where every part of the meal, down to the glass, adds to the narrative and connection we build with guests.\nWhat is your personal favorite aspect of the Jurassic Vineyard Riesling?\nWhat draws me to the Jurassic Vineyard Riesling is its unique character and fascinating origins. The name itself hints at the vineyard’s incredible terroir — fossil-rich soils and the old dinosaur-era oil rigs surrounding it. I especially admire how the limestone-rich soil and proximity to the cool Pacific winds imparts layered minerality and vibrant acidity to the wine, creating a complex, refreshing profile with each sip. It’s truly a wine that tells the story of its ancient landscape.",

    "title": "Too good to go? The second life of leftovers",
    "author": "Ashlie D. Stevens",
    "date": "November 30, 20",
    "text": "Leftovers have always been a bit of a culinary underdog. In pop culture, they’re the sad, wilted contents of plastic containers relegated to sitcom refrigerators — proof of a dinner gone unloved. Yet for me, leftovers have never been a source of shame. Growing up in a family of six, including two perpetually ravenous brothers, leftovers were a rarity, and when they appeared, they were a kind of edible jackpot. The prize might be a sliver of Mom’s baked spaghetti or the last spoonful of Dad’s white chicken chili, spooned unceremoniously onto a tortilla chip or two. In a house where food disappeared almost as quickly as it was made, the idea of leftovers as a burden simply didn’t exist.\nBut the pandemic changed my relationship with leftovers, as it did so many other things. Suddenly, there was no line between breakfast, lunch and dinner — time blurred into endless stretches punctuated by snacks. Cooking at home was both a necessity and a tedium. The monotony of reheating last night’s dinner collided with the allure of delivery apps, which dangled the promise of something new and indulgent. During those early lockdown days, ordering takeout wasn’t just about food; it was also a symbolic act of solidarity with small businesses. Who could resist Thai curry when the alternative was a third day’s helping of tepid spaghetti?\nThat said, the delivery era was relatively short-lived in my kitchen. Inflation hit, the novelty wore off and my credit card bills needed a break. I found myself cooking more, out of both financial prudence and a desire to regain control of my meals. In my now two-person household, his return to home cooking brought an unexpected companion: leftovers.\nAt first, I’ll admit they did feel a bit like a chore, a sign of my failure to portion correctly or eat everything while it was fresh. But somewhere along the way, my perspective shifted. Leftovers became less a consolation prize and more a creative challenge. Inspired by books like \"PlantYou: Scrappy Cooking: 140+ Plant-Based Zero-Waste Recipes That Are Good For You, Your Wallet, and the Planet” — which I read after author Carleigh Bodrug was interviewed by my colleague Michael La Corte — “Perfectly Good Food: A Totally Achievable Zero Waste Approach to Home Cooking,” and Julia Turshen’s absolutely fantastic “What Goes with What: 100 Recipes, 20 Charts, Endless Possibilities,” I started planning meals with their second act already in mind. A pot of roasted vegetables became the filling for quiche. Sunday’s roast chicken transformed into chicken Caesar wraps for an easy weeknight dinner.\nWhat I discovered was a subtle joy in this kind of kitchen alchemy. Leftovers weren’t just practical; they were a form of play. Could I turn two cups of rice and some sad parsley into the backbone of a respectable dinner? Could last night’s roasted carrots hold their own in a salad with miso dressing? The answer, more often than not, was yes.\nIt seems I’m not alone in my reevaluation. Culturally, leftovers are experiencing a kind of rebranding. Apps like Too Good to Go have turned them into a trend. The app, which matches users with heavily discounted “surprise bags” of food from local restaurants and grocery stores, has become one of my favorite indulgences. One morning, I scored a bag of sourdough bagels from a local bakery, which became the base for towering breakfast sandwiches made with leftover roasted vegetables, scrambled eggs and a swipe of pesto. Another time, I received half a container of meatballs in red sauce, which I transformed into a pizza topped with olives and roasted red peppers. I’ve gotten some slightly stale baguettes which made for great baked French toast.\nEven Whole Foods has joined the movement, offering its own grab bags of surplus food via Too Good to Go. A recent haul included a ham sandwich, fresh tortilla chips, pork burritos and a sturdy little tub of mushroom barley soup.\nThe cultural shift extends beyond apps. At restaurants, BYOC (bring your own container) is becoming more common, though the etiquette and legalities of the movement remains a bit murky in the United States. In many Asian and European countries, bringing reusable containers to pack up leftovers has become standard practice, a practical nod to sustainability. However, in Chicago, I’ve spotted diners discreetly pulling silicone containers from their bags at both hole-in-the-wall pho joints and glossy small-plates spots, while mainstream food publications, including Eater, have begun championing this practice, calling on diners to take the responsibility of leftovers into their own hands — literally.\nPall Musaev, CEO of the reusable container company Mr. Lid, recently told me he’s seen an uptick in people bringing his products to restaurants. Musaev envisions a future where restaurants and municipalities work together to promote reusable containers, perhaps even offering branded, swappable ones.\n“What I love about a reusable container is that it is a net benefit the first time you use it,” he said. “From the first-use it is already reducing the need for one single-use container. I do believe that we need to create a functional product that also allows for self-expression. What does your container say about you? Who's your favorite team? What's your personality like? Do you exude luxury?”\nHe said:  “Collaborations will be critical to the success of reusable containers. Not only restaurants, but municipalities will play a key role in facilitating this change by acknowledging gaps in bylaws but also by offering a turnkey solution for patrons and allowing the use of reusable containers. Restaurants and restaurant supply companies could start to get involved and create a turn-key solution of branded, generic containers that are swappable. I believe any restaurant chain that gets in front of this movement will benefit as a leader in the effort to reduce single-use.”\nIt’s a charming, if optimistic, vision of a world where leftovers are not just saved, but celebrated.\nAnd why shouldn’t they be? There’s something inherently hopeful about leftovers. To tuck food away for another day is to believe in the future. To trust that you’ll want that pasta again, that the soup will still be good. It’s a quiet act of care, not just for the planet or your wallet, but for yourself.\nThese days, I see my leftovers as small opportunities — a way to stretch the limits of my creativity, yes, but also a reminder that even the most unassuming meal deserves a second chance.",

For more than 40 years, The Inn has set the standard for fine dining and hospitality, earning numerous accolades. O’Connell and his team have been celebrated with James Beard Awards, including a lifetime achievement award, as well as Michelin stars. The Inn has also received honors from Forbes, AAA, Wine Spectator, and even the White House.\nLocated about 60 miles from Washington, D.C., The Inn is a beacon in the restaurant world, with hospitality at its core. In 2018, it was awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide, a distinction it has retained ever since. As Andrew Lloyd Webber once remarked, “For my money, this little hotel provides the best overall dining experience I can remember in a long while, perhaps my best ever.”\nSalon recently had the opportunity to speak with Chef O’Connell about the origins of The Inn, his commitment to sustainability, his iconic dishes and much more.\nPatrick O'Connell (Photo courtesy of The Inn at Little Washington)\nThe following interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.\nFor those unfamiliar with The Inn at Little Washington, how would you describe its ethos?\nDining at The Inn at Little Washington has been likened to performance art with the guest always playing the starring role. The experience evokes a romantic dinner party in a private country house from another era. Whimsical touches such as our rolling cow — named Faira — displaying cheeses invites guests to relax, be themselves and have fun.\nIn addition to being a 3-Michelin Starred dining destination, The Inn at Little Washington is also the longest tenured Forbes 5 Star property in the world, where the finest culinary and hospitality experiences are delivered with a touch of theatrics.\nThe Inn at Little Washington is a restorative retreat in the Virginia countryside, a place where the extraordinary is the norm and every detail is thoughtfully considered.\nHave there been any menu staples that have been present for your entire tenure?\nSome of the earliest dishes have found their way onto the menu at our newest café, Patty O’s, where they are enjoying great popularity. They are like family friends who have been with us for 46 years.\nThere's a certain timelessness associated with The Inn at Little Washington. What do you attribute that to?\nConsistency is the key to any restaurant’s longevity. In order to stay energized, a restaurant needs to continually reinvent itself, while keeping a thread of continuity. Each time a guest comes, there should be a new element of surprise.\nThe Inn at Little Washington Main Inn Front (Photo courtesy of The Inn at Little Washington)\nI know that you're self-taught. Can you tell me a bit about that?\nThe first job I ever had was in a humble neighborhood restaurant. Perhaps there may be only one advantage to being ‘self taught’. No one is there to tell you that something is impossible.\nIs there a dish on the menu currently that you are proudest of?\nI don’t serve anything I’m not proud of — they are all like my children.\nI know that there's a real focus on sustainability at The Inn at Little Washington and there has been for a long time. You've championed so many important concepts — like farm-to-table, local, sustainable food — for years before those things became \"trends,\" if you will. Can you speak to that a bit?\nSustainability has been at the heart of The Inn at Little Washington since day one — long before it was trendy.\nWhen I first opened The Inn over 46 years ago, we were in a remote corner of Virginia with a limited supply chain, so sourcing locally wasn't just a choice; it was a necessity. But that necessity quickly grew into a passion. We started by partnering with local farms and as time went on, we began growing our own ingredients right here on our 26-acre property.\nToday, we employ two full-time farmers, five gardeners and a beekeeper. We’re one of five restaurants in the US to hold both 3-Michelin Stars and the Michelin Green Star for sustainability.\nBraised Bison Short Rib (Photo courtesy of The Inn at Little Washington)\nThe Inn at Little Washington has had three Michelin stars for a few years now — along with Green Stars — which is arguably the single most impressive accolade a restaurant can receive. What is it like to sustain that level of quality, of high-level food or elite service?\nMany people in our industry agree that maintaining is harder than achieving these accolades.\nWould you say that your drama and acting background plays into your experience at The Inn at Little Washington? How does that background permeate your approach?\nMy background and love of theater is the element that most differentiates us from everyone else in the field. I’ve always felt that the dining experience is ‘living theater’.\nIs there a particular dish over the years that you feel the most affinity for?\nI focus on whatever is in front of me at the moment. Anything that is in season that we’ve grown captures all my interest.\nI'd love to hear more about this iconic butter pecan ice cream! It's quite the legendary recipe.\nIn 1980, Craig Claiborne of the New York Times came for a visit and fell in love with our butter pecan ice cream. He said it was the finest butter pecan ice cream he’s ever tasted. Since then it has taken on a life of its own and seems to have universal appeal. We now serve it at our café.\nThe Inn at Little Washington Foyer (Photo courtesy of The Inn at Little Washington)\nBeyond Michelin and Mobil, The Inn at Little Washington has received accolades from the James Beard Foundation, the International Herald Tribune, Zagat, Travel & Leisure and many, many other publications and organizations, like Wine Spectator, Cigar Aficionado and Gourmet. What is the level of training for staff? It must be incredibly thorough.\nWe never stop learning. We never stop training.\nWant more great food writing and recipes?

What was it like to receive something so validating?\nThere aren't too many awards that you'd happily wait a lifetime for, but this was definitely one of them. I was humbled to join a group of incredibly distinguished icons who have received this rarified award before me. All of them have inspired me.\nDessert (Photo courtesy of The Inn at Little Washington)\nWhat stands out for you as a formative moment that got you into cooking or food at large?\nI sometimes think that the best and the worst thing that ever happened to me was that I got a job in a restaurant at the impressionable age of 15. The addiction was immediate. Once I discovered the intensity of this delicious business I was hooked. More than anything I fell in love with restaurant people. They always seemed to be paying a debt they didn’t owe while struggling to hold onto their dignity.\nIn those days the business was a safe haven for misfits of every persuasion who all seemed to have a whacked sense of humor and a genuine appreciation for the absurdities of life. Because restaurant people were capable of operating in two distinct worlds— “out front” in the dining room and in “in back,” behind the scenes in the kitchen, they made normal people seem one dimensional and infinitely boring by comparison.\nEvery day I felt like I was watching a split screen film with two shows running simultaneously — the fantasy taking place in the dining room juxtaposed with what was going on behind the scenes in the rough and tumble world of the kitchen.\nWhat’s your biggest tip for cutting down on food waste?\nWith over 250 staff to feed every day, twice a day, we don’t have a lot of wasted food.\nWhat's next for you?\nNow that we have just completed the renovation of our newest accommodation, Cardinal’s Nest, we are turning our attention to further expansion. Plans for 10 new guest rooms and a spa have recently been approved.",

    "text": "I had navigated the medical system to make an appointment, filled out pages of forms, answered a nurse’s questions that repeated what had been asked on the form and answered the psychologist’s questions, which repeated the nurses. If you’ve ever heard someone scratch their nails against a chalkboard for an hour straight, you can imagine the feeling in my ADHD body, averse to every single part of this process, yet drawn to the promise: medication.\nIt had taken me years to officially get diagnosed after first hints I might have this neurodevelopmental disorder, and years more to land here, at medication. My life without it is a swirl of forces, leading to natural disasters of impulsivity that often lay waste most acutely in my bank account.\nThe doctor explained that he was newer, and he wanted to bring in the expert. This “expert” came in to the windowless room, leaned against the wall and said, “I’ve never heard about anyone with ADHD struggling with personal finances. Have you tried seeing a therapist?”\nThe dam broke. Tears and a raised voice followed. “Yes, I’ve seen a therapist, as I told him, as I told the nurse, as I filled out on the form.” I was a hysterical woman joining the ranks of generations of women who have sat in a male doctor’s office not being believed. I scrabbled to regain ground. “I wrote about this for the New York Times.”\nThe expert, standing with his arms crossed, looking down at me in the chair, told me I was very emotional. He suggested they increase the dosage of my anxiety medication, and he left.\n“Well then he is, by definition, incompetent,” said an expert I’d interviewed for a previous story, whom I called in desperation.\nHe knows what I now know, that the connection between ADHD and financial struggles is well-documented. A study on the finances of people with ADHD begins: “ADHD has a debilitating influence on everyday functioning, including the capability to make financial decisions.”\nPrevious studies have found that we have trouble with impulse spending (as I said), maxing out credit cards and saving.\n“Furthermore,” the study continues, “compared to adults without ADHD, adults with ADHD showed difficulties in making decisions referring to the future and reported more often to experience impulse buying and the use of a spontaneous or avoidant decision-making style.”\nNot everyone with ADHD is broke. I have friends who are millionaires because of their ADHD. We also have this superpower called hyperfocus, and for some, finances is their hyperfocus. For me, it’s online shopping. When eBay first came out, the dopamine mix of winning and spending led to an only kind of joking roommate intervention.\nBeyond the studies and my own personal history, there’s also the empirical evidence. The discussion board of the Facebook group Neurodivergent Finance/ADHD Finance, with more than 15,000 members, is a wall of desperation. They’re struggling, they’re in debt, they’re broke, they barely made rent, they’ve overspent, they’re asking for help.\nThere’s a well-known (at least for us) concept of the ADHD tax: the extra money you end up paying because of the symptoms of ADHD. Time-blindness causes late fees; object impermanence means we lose things and have to replace them.\nMy struggles with money have been a defining theme of my life. There are realms of adulthood I just can’t get to, because every time I climb a ladder of effort, I fall down a chute of impulsivity. It feels nearly impossible to explain to those without ADHD what’s it’s like to not be able to say what you’ll do in a moment. You promise this time you’ll resist, and then you don’t. Over and over again, for decades. I used to think I was just morally a bad person. Defective.\nThat’s why the ADHD community, the boards and the classes and support groups, have been life-changing. They’ve taught me that I don’t have to berate myself, hate myself, call myself names. I’ve learned to advocate for the person inside here, stuck with this ADHD mind for my entire life, through no decision of my own. And it’s not an excuse; it’s an operating system I’m learning to live with and thrive with.\nBut for professionals to have no idea — for the people who hold the key for many people to not know that this is the reality we live in — is, I agree, incompetent.\nIt’s been nearly a year since that appointment. Even though I continue to struggle, I haven’t yet made my way through the ADHD kryptonite of the medical systems, the forms, to get a second opinion.\nI have no idea how much their ignorance has cost me.",

    "text": "When I published my debut novel (\"The Band,\" from Atria/Simon & Schuster) this year, I unwittingly found myself in an accidental field experiment on whether motherhood is synonymous with \"middle age.\" A few months prior, I was at a toddler's birthday party when my husband casually referred to me and all the same-aged women in the room as \"middle-aged.\" Being 39, I told him the joke was not funny. After a brief poll around the room, all the other husbands and dads agreed: Late 30s was definitely too young to be deemed \"middle-age.\"\nMaybe those men were just better trained to fear their wives’ fury than my own man, or maybe they were biased. After all, every woman that I knew in that room did the conventional thing and married an older guy — some by just a handful of years, a small enough of a gap to warrant having seen the same movies in high school, and some by a lot, enough to raise uncharitable questions about whether “old sperm” was a thing that they should be concerned about, seeing as children were the future and all. So by this logic, if the younger wives were middle-aged, that could only mean their more advanced husbands (in years, at least) were in danger of being at old age’s doorstep. Even so, I chose to believe them. I thought I was safe.\nBut then my novel — which features my fictional doppelgänger as the narrator, who finds herself in a situationship with a Kpop boy bander multiple years her junior — came out, I discovered that in fact, some people automatically assumed that the mother in the book was also middle-aged.\nThe first time it happened, it was in print. A journalist had interviewed me over Zoom about the backstory behind \"The Band,\" and our conversation was the kind that felt like it was between old friends, rather than total strangers who got introduced via a publicist. She was an author herself; also, a woman, and assuming that she didn’t have any fancy Zoom filters or high-tech ring lighting going on, looked approximately in the same age group as me. We chatted effusively about everything from situationships (love them/hate them) to our favorite bands (N’Sync, BTS) and day jobs (professoring, psychologizing, writing) to using prophecy as a plot device (to emulate both the Bible and Shakespeare). Her article, when it came out a few weeks later, reflected the depth and breadth of our conversation along with all the highlights — everything I had hoped for — but one thing that caught my eye was the mention of the middle-aged psychology professor at the center of the book. This was news to me. I had no idea I had written a book about a woman who was halfway to the grave.\nDespite spending the last four years writing, editing, and promoting this baby, the fact that one of its main characters (whose voice, profession, and other demographic labels were largely my own) was already in middle age felt like a revelation — albeit not necessarily a good one. The closest thing I can liken it to is the adult equivalent of finding out that Santa isn’t real or that the tooth fairy just threw your baby teeth in the bathroom trash can after paying you market price for them. It threw me into an existential crisis that started with me going back to my bone-broth regimen (for the collagen, all the well-preserved women of TikTok tell me) and ended with me hungry and asking ChatGPT “What is the definition of middle age?”\nKeep in mind that I make no references or clues to my protagonist’s actual age in the novel and only mention, in passing, her school-aged children, who just so happened to be the same ages as my real children. (As they say, all writing is autobiography.)\nSo I thought that maybe this was a one-off. I moved on with my life and my book promotion, wandered away from my commitment to slow-cooking chicken feet in my Instant Pot for its collagenic properties, and figured that I wasn’t really middle-aged. I comforted myself with reminders: I still got carded for buying alcohol at the grocery store! (At least when I didn’t have my children with me). I still got randos DMing me across my socials! (At least whenever I posted material that didn’t involve books or husbands or kids). I could still fit into the short-shorts I had since college with my alma mater scrawled across the butt! (Although now I have just enough shame to only wear them to bed and not in public, where other women — my age or not — could judge me).\nBut then, during another interview, it happened again. The second time I heard the reference to the \"middle-aged woman\" at the center of the book — much to my shock and awe — was in person. During an author panel at a yacht club, the bookseller interviewing me and another novelist expressed her surprise that the \"middle-aged\" mom in my book was so driven by sex. I, in turn, expressed my surprise that this was a surprise to anybody.\nI looked around the room at the audience. Based on my cursory and non-scientific snap judgment, it looked like most people there were my age; a good number of them were older, as at least one had explicitly pointed out to me during our taco bar lunch earlier that day. I asked them if they stopped caring about or talking about sex after college, or their 20s, or whenever it is when a person transitions from being a young person or generic adult into “middle age,” whatever that is. I stopped just short of asking them about their own sex lives because I still wanted them to like me enough to buy my book.\nAfterward, when I returned to my separate life as a social psychologist and mother myself, I wondered: Is motherhood itself synonymous with middle age?\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nHere's why it matters: As I teach my undergrads every semester in the Psych of Prejudice class they're required to take, ageism is real. By that logic, it's no stretch to unpack the many negative connotations of \"middle-age,\" and to be automatically labeled that because one is a mother is a social liability of motherhood that nobody is talking about, but maybe we should. Because here's what else comes with that: the association between motherhood and all the other things we — myself included — historically associated with aging, like an absent sex drive, a declining openness to experience, irritability and moodiness.\nI grew up across various neighborhoods in China, Puerto Rico, and American cities across the Midwest, the South and the West Coast, and I don't remember knowing any sexy moms. Maybe women just aged faster back then, before Instagrammer mothers who could pass for the same age as their teenage daughters invaded our feeds and told us that anything was possible, especially with the right gym equipment/plastic surgeons/plant-based diets/Korean skincare products. The only time I came close was once in the fifth grade, when my own mother elicited shock and awe from my classmates when she showed up to pick me up from school early in a green velvet dress and face full of makeup.\n“That’s your mom?!” a boy I was madly in love with asked me, clearly impressed. He was probably thinking of his mother, who wore her grays prematurely and her clothes breathable and loose-fitting.\n“Yep,” I replied, smug for the first time that year as the new girl in school already in the comedogenic throes of puberty. But then in the months and years that followed, that green velvet dress disappeared, never to make an appearance again, and instead got replaced with muumuus, as comfortable as they were shapeless. I didn’t think much about it until several years into my own marriage, when my husband would make the oft-repeated joke that if I ever started wearing muumuus myself, we would never see another wedding anniversary. I’d laugh and remind him that I like my outfits uncomfortable and spandex-ridden, partly to keep him on his toes and partly because my self-esteem is unstable so I could use all the help I could get, particularly in the form of attention from strangers. But also because I believe in the mom who still relishes being seen for herself and not just as an extension of what she can do for other people.\nAs I approach my 40th birthday — which might soon usher me officially into middle-age-dom myself — I’m comforted by the oft-cited finding that a 40-year-old woman (and mother) usually has the sex drive of a single (and childless) 18-year-boy. In this climate, few stats give me more hope for the future.",

    "text": "On November 8, 2016, I voted for Donald Trump. I was one of a large percentage of white women in the United States who cast their vote for Trump.\nI’d never considered myself a political individual. I was born into a family that didn’t discuss politics at all, only religion, and only in the context of our own denominations of Christianity and proselytizing. I was raised in a lower-class, white, rural American household in the 1970s and '80s. The only political terms I ever recall hearing in my younger years were Republican and “conservative,” and never in my own home.\nHere is my first political memory: It was 1988, and I heard Ted Koppel recap the presidential victory of Republican George H.W. Bush on ABC’s \"Nightline\" while I lost my virginity on my parent’s couch the night before I got married at 17.\nAt that point, I’d given up on the hope of college or any of the aspirations I’d had earlier in high school, like studying law or teaching at the university level. Without money for college, there were few options in my Midwest farm town. Maybe I could have been a bank teller or an assembly line worker in a local manufacturing plant, or worked retail. Or there was marriage.\nThat union didn't last. When I remarried in 2004, I was a single mother with a GED and a failed college course or two under my belt. I didn’t talk about politics with this husband, either, except for one brief, pre-marital discussion. I told my fiancé over the chicken strip special at O’Charley’s that I believed in women’s rights, though in hindsight I had very little knowledge of what that really meant. I told him I considered myself a “very liberal conservative.”\nI committed myself to being a “tradwife,” or a traditional evangelical Christian wife. I was submissive to my husband who’d been deemed the head of our household by biblical Scripture. I kept and managed our home as required. I took care of the kids, worked at least part-time when child care permitted, prepared homemade meals and baked goods, did all the laundry for our large family and managed our finances, which was more of a “rob Peter to pay Paul” enterprise. When my husband wanted to see my breasts or have sex, and I didn't, he would hold up his left hand and tap his wedding band, and I'd acquiesce. I’d been told God commanded me to meet his needs, for casseroles and otherwise. From an evangelical Christian standpoint, I did everything I could do to be a good God-honoring wife except be silent.\nIn 2012, I started paying more attention to politics. I watched the Obama/Romney debate. That was also the year I returned to college to finish my degree. I would ultimately go on to get my Masters. My husband also set off in pursuit of his degree — a four-year leadership and ministry program to become a pastor. At that point, I was still a political agnostic.\nIn 2016, I planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. I’d never been a fan of Donald Trump’s brand of ostentatious wealth and womanizing. Something had started to shift in me in the final year of getting my bachelor’s degree. I was in my 40s, my children were leaving home, and I worked two part-time jobs on campus. By then, my husband was a full-time pulpit minister. I was “first lady” of a small country church congregation and I wanted more. I started demanding a more equitable division of household labor like dishes. I stopped doing his laundry. These were my first signs of rebellion.\nOn election day, my husband and I met at a local Wesleyan church and went inside to cast our votes together.\n“You go on,” I told my husband as my voter registration was confirmed. He finally took off toward a couple of unoccupied booths on the opposite side of the room.\nI stood behind the curtain, my palms suddenly sweating, my heartbeat galloping in my ears. Though I had been determined to vote for Hillary Clinton, I couldn’t do it. I knew I’d never be able to lie when my husband asked who I’d voted for. There had already been some tension overall in the marriage, but especially around any conversation where I interjected my thoughts and opinions about Clinton or anything remotely “feminist.”\nI wasn’t afraid of physical repercussions. But verbal debasement, and the threat of an extended punishment of silence and dismissal, held me back.\n“I’m not sure you going back to school was the best decision,” he’d said to me, more than once. “You need to stop reading so much” was another. I had to tread lightly.\nThroughout election night, he scrolled on his phone and made the occasional joke while I paced around the living room as state after state was called for Clinton. The popular vote set Hillary Clinton on a course for the White House, but then came the cutting sting of defeat as the electoral college votes swung the election results in favor of Trump.\n“I’m going to bed, and you should too,” he said.\nHe turned off the television, and then the light as he left the room, like I wasn’t there.\nIn 2020, I voted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris by mail-in ballot without my husband’s knowledge. This was after four years of an increasingly unstable Trump and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I had been in school for several years, engaged with a diverse, well-educated community that empowered me to be more vocal about my opinions, political and otherwise.\nAcross the board in my personal life, I’d become emboldened. We moved to North Carolina so I could attend a graduate writing program. He was angry that I even considered uprooting our empty nest for such a pursuit. Making the decision myself, and forcing the issue, was antithetical to his expectation that I continue to be a submissive wife. But it was part of the slow burn of my rebellion, of a deconstruction of the woman I’d been conditioned to be.\nThe decision to leave that woman behind hasn’t been without consequence.\nWhen Kamala Harris appeared on the cover of Vogue in January 2021, he flipped the magazine over on the kitchen table after I’d brought it in from the mailbox. Even today, he claims that both sides were to blame on January 6. Like Trump, he intentionally mispronounces Kamala as “Ka-MA-la.”\nRecently, he tried to goad me into a political debate in the kitchen, claiming that saying Donald Trump is a threat to democracy is akin to inciting violence, and that the presidential debate between Harris and Trump was rigged. When I would try to present any fact-based rebuttal, he would say, “This is what they want.”\nI no longer recognize the man I married 20 years ago. I left him once in 2020, and again last year, but was forced to return for financial reasons. For a while, I held out hope that with time and credible information, he would somehow snap out of the ultra-conservative, extremist-leaning, blind loyalty he seems to have embraced. I no longer hold onto that hope. We get through the days, and I hope for the best, imagining a stronger, brighter future for myself.\nNow, in 2024, saying the stakes are considerably higher than they were eight years ago feels like a gross understatement. The threat of violence, loss of personal freedoms, and the prospect of the implementation of Project 2025 make it impossible for me to consider casting any other vote than for Kamala Harris. But I won’t consider my vote for Harris as being forced to choose between the “lesser of two evils.” The hope and the joy of the Harris/Walz campaign along with Harris’s plans for her potential presidency, economic and otherwise, compared to the malignant vitriol, incoherence, hatred and racism from Trump — for me, there’s never been a clearer choice.\nI might still be a woman financially dependent on her evangelical husband. I’m working on that. But I’m no longer the woman who fears the repercussions of not voting with him. I won’t hide my vote. To be silent is to be complicit. To be silent is to continue to deny the intelligent, well-educated woman that I am. I found my voice. My vote is my voice.",

    "date": "October 31, 2",
    "text": "“This is a completely crazy place — look at those graves!” A young, well-heeled couple stood at a window of the renovated church where my partner and I had found ourselves on a Sunday afternoon. The man apparently didn’t like what he was seeing.\nOutside, a ramshackle cemetery ringed the church, its worn gravestones toppled this way and that like fallen dominos. Those whose inscriptions were not smudged out by time revealed little of the people buried beneath.\nNearby, a tractor buzzed lazily around a hayfield, the aroma of the newly cut grass wafting through the church’s open windows. Even with its pews and stained glass removed, it felt somehow sanctified.\n“There’s just no separation,” the young woman mused. “I want to love it, but that cemetery is just depressing.”\n“The only good part about owning this house would be that we would be all set for Halloween,” the man smirked. They quickly left.\nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, was not put off by the cemetery. He was entranced. “I like the graves,” he said. “Think of all those stories.” I didn’t know it was possible to fall more in love with him, but I did that day.\nDespite being featured on the Zillow Gone Wild Instagram account, the house sat on the market for nearly a year with no offers, its price steadily dropping. I kept coming to see it with my boyfriend, drawn by some connection I only dimly understood. Perhaps it was because death was very much on my mind.\nI’d recently turned 50 and had become preoccupied with what it would feel like to attend my father’s funeral. He’d been the man I’d most loved and hated in my life, and now he was dying. Years earlier, after a series of unresolved conflicts and missed birthdays, I’d lost contact with him. Already feeling like our relationship was one-sided, I’d conducted an experiment: If I stopped calling him, how long would it take him to call me? The answer turned out to be never. I hadn’t intended our relationship to end, but when a year passed, then two, I had to admit that it probably had.\nFor most of my life, I’d idolized my father. Nothing mattered more to me than his approval, even adopting his sneering disdain for my mother to please him. But after I had kids of my own, to my surprise, my father took little interest. “When they can hold a conversation, I’ll be happy to call,” he joked. My mother, on the other hand, sent them artfully curated book collections and handmade valentines. Did I have it wrong all along?\nThen, after her own health scare, my mother said she had something to tell me.\n“There are things you never knew,” she said. “Your dad used to hurt me during our conflicts. He would grab me. Hard.” Reflexively, she rubbed her upper arms.\n“How hard?’ I asked, realizing immediately it was the wrong question. The instinct to defend him was hard to shake.\n“Enough that I had to wear long sleeves to cover up the bruises,” she responded, softly.\nI’d already come to view the way he had recruited me into his contempt of her during their almost 20-year marriage with revulsion. Still, when she disclosed the physical abuse, I had the vertiginous feeling of falling. Was my whole childhood a fiction? Sometimes that worry makes me feel like I’m parenting without a map.\nIn third grade, my eldest daughter earned a place in her school-wide spelling bee.\n“I don’t want your help!” she cried when I tried to quiz her on the way to school. “I’m not even sure I want to do it.”\nDo it? When I qualified for a regional spelling bee at 11, my father prepared elaborate flash cards and put me on a strict schedule for weeks until letters and words filled my dreams. I could still feel the intoxicating fizz of his attention, and the sticky shame after I got knocked out in the second round. When my daughter’s turn came up to go on stage, she turned on her heels and marched back to her seat beside me.\n“What are you doing?!” I hissed.\n“I changed my mind,” she said, crossing her arms.\n“Get on stage! Hurry, it’s still your turn!” I could hear the shrillness in my voice. In the silence that followed, I realized that nearly everyone in the auditorium had heard it too. I sat down heavily, a lump in my throat.\n“I hate you! You didn’t even ask me why!” my daughter screamed at me later that day.\nShe was right; it hadn’t even occurred to me. My darkest fear is that I am not all that different from my father. That dread is especially hard in the moments I find myself acting exactly like him.\nMy complicated history with my father has made it difficult to let any man in. Whenever anyone got too close, I would sabotage things. Most of the time, though, I just picked the wrong men; it made being disappointed easier. Deep down, I believed I did not deserve better. Then I fell hard for a man who made me feel, for the first time in my life, both known and loved. Of course, it made me want to end things with him immediately.\nWhen I tried to shake him though, he held tight. Even so, our relationship had a certain tenuousness. How do you create a life with someone when you are in your 50s and not going to have children together or get married? What did we have that was just ours? The closer we became, the more I felt completely out on a limb.\n“Let’s do this,” my boyfriend said about the house after one last look on a bitterly cold winter day. Rain puddled around the gravestones, making them seem as if they might sink into the ground. “Halloween will be great,” he said.\nWe moved in on a beautiful clear spring morning and I promptly picked a huge fight with him.\n“Can you please lower your voice?” he asked, trying to de-escalate.\nWhat I heard was: “I want to break up.”\n“What? No,” he sighed. “Here’s how this works, Sarah — I am staying. We are in this together.” He brought my fingers to his mouth and kissed them.\nIn high school, we read \"Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\" in philosophy class. “On a cycle, the frame is gone,” Robert Pirsig wrote. “You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is overwhelming.”\nLiving beside a cemetery is a lot like riding a motorcycle — the sense of presence is overwhelming. Mourners make their way onto our property where they kneel beside their chosen headstone. Then there are the Girl Scouts who plant flags on holidays, the volunteers from the cemetery nonprofit who prop up the stones that have toppled over, and the curious passersby. “I feel like you are taking care of my grandfather,” one woman told me, giving me a hug.\nI look out on the crumbling graves while drinking my morning coffee, mist rising from the yard, and feel a swell of love for them. Cemetery ownership can be challenging, but the responsibility I feel to care for the graves also brings a deep connection. I trim the grass and pick up the vases when they fall. After I started putting poetry up on the church marquee outside, poetry recommendations began slipping under our door. I hang them dutifully. The Girl Scouts have come to expect hot chocolate. I’m never too busy to engage with a mourner about their loved one.\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\nSince buying our house, I’ve stopped thinking so much about what my boyfriend and I don’t share. Stewarding other people’s stories, it turns out, has strengthened ours.\nA few months ago, multiple family members encouraged me to come say goodbye to my father as his death rapidly approaches. For a while, it was all I could think about: Would I regret not mending our relationship, or at least trying? “You have to go,” my boyfriend advised.\nWeeks later, I sat in my father's room in the retirement home where he will no doubt spend his remaining days. There he was, sitting on the edge of the bed, his thin, frail frame doubled over. That day, I realized I’d been struggling with the wrong question. It wasn’t about whether he deserved my absolution; it was about whether I would be the kind of person who could give it. Forgiving my father wasn’t for him, so he could die in peace. It was for me so I could live in it.\nI’ve learned that cemeteries, too, aren’t really for the dead. They’re for the living. They give us a chance to remember people as we wish, maybe to wash away some of the bitterness or hurt feelings we might have felt when they were alive. Our cemetery has been like that for me. But it’s also been a reminder that all things broken and complicated deserve a home and to be loved. For the first time in my life, I’ve started believing that I do, too.",

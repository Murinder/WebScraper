    "text": "A federal appeals court has ruled that Idaho can enforce its abortion travel ban, which prohibits minors from traveling out of state for abortions without parental consent. The decision Monday by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 2023 decision that had blocked the law on First Amendment grounds.The law, signed last year by Gov. Brad Little (R), created a new felony called “abortion trafficking,” defined as when an “adult ... with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor, either procures an abortion … or obtains an abortion-inducing drug” for that minor. “Abortion trafficking” also involves “recruiting, harboring, or transporting” a pregnant minor for an abortion, the law states. Violations are punishable by two to five years in prison.The law’s sweeping language criminalizes anyone transporting a pregnant minor without parental consent within Idaho to get any abortion care, even outside a clinic. It could apply to a grandmother driving a pregnant minor to the post office to pick up a package containing abortion medication, for example. The court of appeals largely upheld the law, except for the language that prohibited “recruiting,” a vague term that was not defined within the law. The panel of judges found the recruiting provision is “unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expressive speech.” Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a vocal opponent of abortion, called the ruling a “tremendous victory” in a press release.“Idaho’s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother,” Labrador said. “Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.”Idaho’s law is one of two in the country that prohibit minors from traveling out of state for abortion care. It was the first to be implemented after Roe v. Wade fell and is the only law of its kind that carries a felony punishment. “This decision is devastating for young people in Idaho and the trusted adults who support them,” Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai‘i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, said in a press release. “Instead of protecting our youth, this law puts them in harm’s way,” she continued. “It forces minors in abusive households to disclose pregnancies, often with severe consequences, while also criminalizing those who would offer them help.”Idaho is one of the most extreme anti-abortion states in the country. The state implemented a six-week ban with a private enforcement mechanism as soon as Roe fell, and Little signed a near-total abortion ban just a month later. Idaho went all the way to the Supreme Court to argue that women should not be able to access abortion care during a medical emergency, claiming that Idaho’s abortion ban overrides federal law that requires most hospitals to offer abortion care if necessary to stabilize the health of a pregnant patient.Read the Ninth Circuit Court’s decision below:",

    "text": "Mehmet Oz, the television-personality doctor and Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, pitched herbal supplements and other products to his millions of social media followers without properly disclosing that he had a business relationship with the company selling them, according to a letter published Tuesday. Oz’s undisclosed ads may have broken influencer marketing rules, the watchdog group Public Citizen wrote to the Federal Trade Commission. Specifically, Oz is a “global advisor and stakeholder” with iHerb, which sells everything from vitamins and supplements to pet food. And though he makes that disclosure on his X and Instagram profile pages, Oz doesn’t mention anything about his connection to iHerb in the actual videos he posts about its products on social media, as required by FTC rules. Oz pitched iHerb’s ashwagandha capsules just a few days ago, iHerb multivitamins a few days prior, and in October, he urged followers to “create a healthy foundation to defend against Halloween excesses with California Gold’s multivitamin & mineral” and plugged “exclusive discounts” for the company, which he called “my trusted source,” all without disclosing his actual business relationship to iHerb on the individual videos. In September, he plugged iHerb’s “daily deals” on products like Life Extension, “NAD+ Cell Regenerator” supplement and pecans. “My friends, living your best life is easy to achieve when you shop at iHerb,” Trump’s pick to lead CMS said. “[Oz’s] video posts do not disclose his financial connections, nor does the accompanying text. Nor do the posts contain other disclosures such as #ad,” said the Public Citizen letter, addressed to the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. It noted past warnings sent to other influencers over similar issues and urged the bureau to investigate whether Oz had violated FTC policy on undisclosed endorsements and product advertisements, and to “take appropriate action.” “As you know, a longstanding, core principle of fair advertising law in the United States is that people have a right to know when they are being advertised to,” Public Citizen’s co-president Robert Weissman wrote. The letter noted guidance from the FTC last year concerning the application of the FTC Act — which governs “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” — to the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising. The guidance gave the example of an influencer “who is paid to endorse a vitamin product in their social media posts [and] discloses their connection to the product’s manufacturer only on the profile pages of their social media accounts.”“The disclosure is not clear and conspicuous because people seeing their paid posts could easily miss the disclosure,” the guidance said.“The logic of this rule is clear,” Weissman wrote. “Because most people will miss the disclosure in the profile page, that disclosure does not adequately inform consumers and enable them to contextualize the advertisement they are seeing as an advertisement.”The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment about the Public Citizen letter.Oz’s potential conflicts of interest and his promotion of drugs, supplements and medical devices as a television host and social media personality could complicate his potential job in the Trump administration, as the The Washington Post and New York Times have detailed in recent days. During a Senate hearing in 2014, for example, Oz acknowledged that claims about products he’d featured on his show “don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact,” but said he personally believed in them anyway.And in 2019, Oz did a glowing segment on the weight-loss drug Ozempic, in which he mentioned the drug’s manufacturer, “trusted partner” Novo Nordisk. The company acknowledged sponsoring the segment to the Post, but said it didn’t have an ongoing relationship with Oz. The Post noted Oz still promotes the drug on his website, as well as another drug, iHerb’s Collagen-Up, which he describes as an answer to sagging skin resulting from weight loss, which has been called “Ozempic face.” If he does ultimately lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Oz could play a role in answering the open question of whether the federal government should cover weight-loss medicine for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries — particularly if the drugs help overweight patients with noncosmetic weight issues like heart problems and diabetes. “It’s a big battle happening now” over insurance coverage for Wegovy, another weight-loss drug, Oz said in a video last November. “I think Medicare is going to be the real finish line. Are they going to cover weight-loss drugs? They’re not allowed to, by law, but Wegovy appears to do more than just help with weight loss.” A Trump transition spokesperson told the Post that “all nominees and appointees will comply with the ethical obligations of their respective agencies.”",

Fuck that guy. Daniel Cray-ig? I’m so sorry. Please accept my apology.”Craig has appeared on the “Late Show” nearly every other year since 2015 and is currently promoting Luca Guadagnino’s adaptation of William S.

    "text": "Ann Coulter doesn’t think highly of Donald Trump’s controversial nominee to lead the Department of Defense — but it’s not because he’s been accused of rape.The conservative commentator skewered Fox News host Pete Hegseth’s character during Monday’s episode of her podcast, “Unsafe with Ann Coulter,” but appeared to dismiss Hegseth’s rape accuser and instead took issue with his cheating, calling Trump’s Cabinet pick “sleazy” and a “serial adulterer.”Hegseth was investigated for allegedly raping a woman after speaking at an event for Republican women in 2017. Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing a lack of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”The news anchor, who has been married three times and was in the midst of his second divorce at the time of the alleged rape, has repeatedly claimed that the encounter was consensual.Coulter appears to have accepted his explanation and suggested on Monday’s episode that it was possible Hegseth’s accuser had “cried rape.”She did, however, take issue with his adultery.“In all of this talk about about whether whether Pete Hegseth is an abuser of women, it just, no one even mentioned that he is a serial adulterer!” she told listeners. “Are we a society that doesn’t care about adultery anymore?”Noting that not one but two of Hegseth’s divorces reportedly stemmed from infidelity, Coulter said, “The fact that it was three times, and this sleazy, and everyone at Fox News knew about it is one thing. But seriously ... No one is even mentioning the adultery!”Somehow, Coulter then found a way to blame Democrats for Hegseth’s moral failures.“I’m sorry, this is liberals winning,” she told listeners. “This is liberals changing our culture in this subtle and insidious way where the only rules that matter are the feminist rules, not the rules that have protected women for millennia, like don’t cheat on your wife.”While Hegseth was not charged over the 2017 rape allegation, his own mother called him an “abuser of women” in 2018 email that recently came to light.“You are an abuser of women — that is the ugly truth and I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego,” she wrote to her son.Trump’s willingness to overlook the controversy around Hegseth may have a lot to do with his own history. The president-elect has been accused of sexual abuse by dozens of women over his decades in the public eye.",

    "author": "Sara Boboltz",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 04:40 PM EST",
    "text": "Attorneys for Donald Trump filed a request Tuesday, as expected, asking New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan to dismiss the hush money case against the president-elect despite the guilty verdict delivered in May.The lengthy filing comes after Merchan indefinitely delayed Trump’s sentencing date last month, following his reelection, as sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted. His sentencing had already been pushed back several times due to the Supreme Court’s landmark decision expanding presidential immunity.Nothing short of a full dismissal will do, Trump’s attorneys argued, objecting to the idea of postponing the sentencing to the end of Trump’s second term in 2029.“[I]t would be egregious and unlawful for this Court to hold the prospect of a 2029 sentencing over President Trump’s head while he continues his service to this Country,” the filing read. The lawyers’ arguments centered on the immunity ruling and the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause establishing that the federal government takes precedence over state-level affairs. But much of the document was devoted to arguing that the trial itself had been unfair to Trump.The lawyers cited President Joe Biden’s recent decision to pardon his son to argue that Trump, like Hunter Biden, was “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted” and “treated differently.”“Since [Manhattan District Attorney Alvin] Bragg took office, he has engaged in ‘precisely the type of political theater’ that President Biden condemned,” Trump’s filing read. “This case would never have been brought were it not for President Trump’s political views, the transformative national movement established under his leadership, and the political threat that he poses to entrenched, corrupt politicians in Washington, D.C., and beyond.” The lawyers said that proceeding with sentencing in “this failed lawfare case” would improperly disrupt the incoming president’s transition. A jury of New Yorkers found Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts in a case that revolved around a $130,000 payment to the porn actor Stormy Daniels made in the days leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The payment was wired by Trump’s personal attorney at the time, Michael Cohen, who was subsequently reimbursed in monthly installments over a period of around a year. Bragg’s office successfully argued that the repayment scheme constituted falsified business records, as the expense was described as legal services instead of a payment intended to influence an election. But the Supreme Court’s July ruling on presidential immunity threw a wrench into the case. Trump’s attorneys asked for more time to figure out how the ruling applies to the charges against Trump, who was in the White House during the period of time he was signing checks reimbursing Cohen.The high court decreed that presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for all official actions taken as part of the duties of their office.While Bragg did not object to Merchan canceling Trump’s most recent sentencing date, he indicated he would fight the attempt to completely dismiss the case. His office is expected to file their response to the Trump team’s brief later this month.",

    "title": "South Korea Lifts President's Martial Law Decree After Lawmakers Reject Military Rule",
    "author": "",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 09:23 AM EST",
    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The president of South Korea early Wednesday lifted the martial law he imposed on the country hours earlier, bending to political pressure after a tense night in which troops surrounded parliament and lawmakers voted to reject military rule.President Yoon Suk Yeol, who appeared likely to be impeached over his actions, imposed martial law late Tuesday out of frustration with the opposition, vowing to eliminate “anti-state” forces as he struggles against opponents who control parliament and that he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.Police and military personnel were seen leaving the grounds of parliament following the bipartisan vote to overrule the president, and the declaration was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting.Parliament acted swiftly after martial law was imposed, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that the law was “invalid” and that lawmakers would “protect democracy with the people.”In all, martial law was in effect for about six hours.The president’s surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon’s own conservative party.Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party’s lawmakers would remain in the Assembly’s main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.Woo applauded how troops quickly left the Assembly after the vote.“Even with our unfortunate memories of military coups, our citizens have surely observed the events of today and saw the maturity of our military,” Woo said.While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament’s attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. He said lawmakers had engaged in “unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.”Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker, claimed that security camera footage following Yoon’s declaration showed that troops moved in a way that suggested they were trying to arrest Lee, Woo and even Han Dong-hoon, the leader of Yoon’s People Power Party.Officials from Yoon’s office and the Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment early Wednesday.Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon’s impeachment.Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers’ vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting “Aren’t you embarrassed?”Under South Korea’s constitution, the president can declare martial law during “wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states” that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.When martial law is declared, “special measures” can be employed to restrict freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.Following Yoon’s announcement of martial law, South Korea’s military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause “social confusion” would be suspended, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. The military said anyone who violated the decree could be arrested without a warrant.In Washington, the White House said the U.S. was “seriously concerned” by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden’s administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement and was in contact with the South Korean government.Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the more than 27,000 U.S. service members based in South Korea.The South Korean military also said that the country’s striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools.Soon after martial law was declared, the parliament speaker called on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to “remain calm and hold their positions.All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law.At one point, television footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building. An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.The leader of Yoon’s conservative party called the decision to impose martial law “wrong.” Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, said Yoon’s announcement was “illegal and unconstitutional.”Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help “rebuild and protect” the country from “falling into the depths of national ruin.” He said he would “eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.”“I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,” he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate “some inconveniences.”Yoon — whose approval rating dipped in recent months — has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.His party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the central Seoul prosecutors’ office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.During his televised announcement, Yoon also described the opposition as “shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces who are plundering the freedom and happiness of our citizens.” He did not elaborate.Yoon has taken a hard line on North Korea over its nuclear ambitions, departing from the policies of his liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who pursued inter-Korean engagement.Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals.Yoon’s move was the first declaration of martial law since the country’s democratization in 1987. The country’s last previous martial law was in October 1979, following the assassination of former military dictator Park Chung-hee.Sydney Seiler, Korean chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that the move was symbolic for Yoon to express his frustration with the opposition-controlled parliament.“He has nothing to lose,” said Seiler, comparing Yoon’s move to the Hail Mary pass in American football, with a slim chance of success.Now Yoon faces likely impeachment, a scenario that was also possible before he made the bold move, Seiler said.Natalia Slavney, research analyst at the Stimson Center’s 38 North website that focuses on Korean affairs, said Yoon’s imposition of martial law was “a serious backslide of democracy” that followed a “worrying trend of abuse” since he took office in 2022.South Korea “has a robust history of political pluralism and is no stranger to mass protests and swift impeachments,” Slavney said, citing the example of former President Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, who was ousted from office and imprisoned for bribery and other crimes in 2017.___Associated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, and Matt Lee, Didi Tang and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Biden Is Ending A Controversial Program From 1938 — But Trump Will Get The Final Say",
    "author": "Dave Jamieson",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 11:58 AM EST",
    "text": "The Labor Department said Tuesday that it would be phasing out a long-running and controversial program that allows certain employers to pay workers with disabilities less than the minimum wage. The new rule eliminating the program follows years of pressure from disability rights groups and is meant to deliver on a campaign pledge from President Joe Biden. But its future is uncertain due to likely legal challenges as well as the incoming Trump administration.Kristin Garcia, deputy administrator of the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division, said the reform is consistent with the principle that workers deserve fair pay for a hard day’s work. “For too long, workers with disabilities have been left out of that promise,” Garcia told reporters Tuesday.The federal government’s endorsement of a sub-minimum wage for workers with disabilities dates to 1938, when Congress created a wage floor under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Eligible employers receive certificates from the Labor Department allowing them to pay well below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.A 2023 study from the Government Accountability Office found that around 120,000 workers were employed under what are known as 14(c) certificates, so named for the section of the law that allows them. Half of those workers were earning less than $3.50 per hour. Many of the workers are employed in community rehabilitation programs and nonprofits, including Goodwill, and the vast majority have an intellectual or developmental disability. It’s common for these workers to earn wages on “piece rate,” so that they’re paid according to how many tasks they complete in a given time rather than a standard hourly rate.While backers of the program argue many employees will lose their jobs without it, critics say it’s an antiquated practice that discriminates against an entire workforce and furthers income inequality. Taryn Williams, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy, said Tuesday that the expectations for workers with disabilities have “evolved” over the decades and no longer match the law as it was written during the Great Depression.“Employers today have more resources and training available to recruit, hire, retain and advance workers with disabilities in employment at or above the full minimum wage, and this proposed rule aligns with that reality,” she said.Under the proposed rule, the government would no longer issue new certificates allowing a sub-minimum wage for workers with disabilities. Existing certificates would be phased out three years after the rule goes into effect. Workers employed under current certificates could remain in their jobs, but the employer would have to pay them at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. That would “lead to greater financial stability, increased purchasing power and independence” for those workers,” Garcia said.The rule must undergo a public comment period and wouldn’t be finalized until after Biden has left the White House. The new Trump administration could choose to ditch the rule and keep the current system intact.",

    "text": "Shailene Woodley seems to still have some painful feelings about her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers.In a new interview with Outside magazine, the “Divergent” star admits that she still has a hard time talking about the NFL quarterback, with whom she broke up in February 2022.“I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron because it always makes me cry,” Woodley told the magazine, growing tearful. “It was not right. But it was beautiful.”In the article, Woodley keeps mentions of her ex to a minimum, but said she “had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022,” which she said led to months of depression.“I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety and, like, complete soul detachment,” Woodley said, noting that she stayed in a “toxic situation” because “empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone.”In a 2023 interview, Woodley spoke about the challenges of dating someone “very, very famous” because with it came “scrutiny, opinions, the desire for people to know my life and his life and our life.”Woodley and Rodgers started dating during the pandemic, and she announced their engagement in February 2021.During her relationship with Rodgers, Woodley defended him against a Daily Mail article that misidentified a man in Los Angeles as the Green Bay Packers quarterback and falsely claimed he had violated the NFL’s COVID-19 protocols by breaking quarantine.She said that the man mistaken for Rodgers didn’t have the same, er, body proportions as her beau.“I know Aaron’s body VERY well. First off his feet, ahem and no offense to this rando dude, are a LOT bigger,” Woodley wrote, added a winking emoji.Meanwhile, Rodgers’ most public comment about the relationship came after the breakup, when he thanked Woodley on Instagram for “letting me chase after you the first couple months after we met, and finally letting me catch up to you and be a part of your life.”",

    "text": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the Donald Trump-loving senator who once called the president-elect a “sniveling coward,” on Monday derided MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski for reconnecting with Trump after criticizing him.“I’m not even sure they were kissing the ring. I think they were kissing a little bit lower than that,” the senator told Fox News’ Sean Hannity of the “Morning Joe” personalities. “They’re desperate for relevance,” he added.The irony wasn’t lost on critics, who pointed out that Cruz was once a fierce Trump critic. The senator, who ran against Trump in the 2016 GOP primary, called his opponent a “small and petty man,” a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral” before Trump was elected president.He eventually became an ardent Trump sycophant even though the former president insulted his wife, Heidi Cruz, insinuating she was ugly, and linked his father, Rafael Cruz, to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The “Morning Joe” hosts have faced backlash from progressives and conservatives alike, and tanking viewership numbers, after they met with Trump at his Florida resort after the election.They said they had agreed to “restart communications” with Trump even though they don’t “see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues and we told him so.” They were some of Trump’s most vocal critics on cable news in recent years, and in the lead-up to the election, likened him to a fascist.

    "text": "Attorneys for Donald Trump filed a request Tuesday, as expected, asking New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan to dismiss the hush money case against the president-elect despite the guilty verdict delivered in May.The lengthy filing comes after Merchan indefinitely delayed Trump’s sentencing date last month, following his reelection, as sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted. His sentencing had already been pushed back several times due to the Supreme Court’s landmark decision expanding presidential immunity.Nothing short of a full dismissal will do, Trump’s attorneys argued, objecting to the idea of postponing the sentencing to the end of Trump’s second term in 2029.“[I]t would be egregious and unlawful for this Court to hold the prospect of a 2029 sentencing over President Trump’s head while he continues his service to this Country,” the filing read. The lawyers’ arguments centered on the immunity ruling and the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause establishing that the federal government takes precedence over state-level affairs. But much of the document was devoted to arguing that the trial itself had been unfair to Trump.The lawyers cited President Joe Biden’s recent decision to pardon his son to argue that Trump, like Hunter Biden, was “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted” and “treated differently.”“Since [Manhattan District Attorney Alvin] Bragg took office, he has engaged in ‘precisely the type of political theater’ that President Biden condemned,” Trump’s filing read. “This case would never have been brought were it not for President Trump’s political views, the transformative national movement established under his leadership, and the political threat that he poses to entrenched, corrupt politicians in Washington, D.C., and beyond.” The lawyers said that proceeding with sentencing in “this failed lawfare case” would improperly disrupt the incoming president’s transition. A jury of New Yorkers found Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts in a case that revolved around a $130,000 payment to the porn actor Stormy Daniels made in the days leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The payment was wired by Trump’s personal attorney at the time, Michael Cohen, who was subsequently reimbursed in monthly installments over a period of around a year. Bragg’s office successfully argued that the repayment scheme constituted falsified business records, as the expense was described as legal services instead of a payment intended to influence an election. But the Supreme Court’s July ruling on presidential immunity threw a wrench into the case. Trump’s attorneys asked for more time to figure out how the ruling applies to the charges against Trump, who was in the White House during the period of time he was signing checks reimbursing Cohen.The high court decreed that presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for all official actions taken as part of the duties of their office.While Bragg did not object to Merchan canceling Trump’s most recent sentencing date, he indicated he would fight the attempt to completely dismiss the case. His office is expected to file their response to the Trump team’s brief later this month.",

    "title": "South Korea’s Opposition Parties Submit Motion To Impeach President Over Martial Law Decree",
    "author": "",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 08:33 PM EST",
    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s opposition parties Wednesday submitted a motion to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over the shocking and short-lived martial law that drew heavily armed troops to encircle parliament before lawmakers climbed walls to reenter the building and unanimously voted to lift his order.Impeaching Yoon would require the support of two-thirds of parliament and at least six justices of the nine-member Constitutional Court would have to support it to remove him from office. The motion, submitted jointly by the main opposition Democratic Party and five smaller opposition parties, could be put to a vote as early as Friday.Yoon’s senior advisers and secretaries offered to resign collectively and his Cabinet members, including Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, were also facing calls to step down, as the nation struggled to make sense of what appeared to be a poorly-thought-out stunt.In his speech announcing the abrupt order Tuesday night, Yoon vowed to eliminate “anti-state” forces and continued to criticize parliament’s attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. But martial law lasted only about six hours, as the National Assembly voted to overrule Yoon and the declaration was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting.The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament, said Wednesday that its lawmakers decided to call on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him.“President Yoon Suk Yeol’s martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn’t abide by any requirements to declare it,” the Democratic Party said in a statement. “His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.”Impeaching him would require support from 200 of the National Assembly’s 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats. But the rejection of Yoon’s martial law declaration in a 190-0 vote included the votes of 18 lawmakers from Yoon’s ruling People Power Party, according to National Assembly officials.The leader of the People Power Party, Han Dong-hun, who has long ties with Yoon dating to their days as prosecutors, criticized Yoon’s martial law declaration as “unconstitutional.”Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, seen as a potential presidential hopeful for the People Power Party, said Yoon’s martial law declaration went against the “fundamental spirit of democracy” and that the deployment of troops to the National Assembly was an act that violated the separation of powers.“Right now, the most urgent task is a thorough investigation. Through this, we must clearly hold accountable those who participated in destroying democracy,” Oh said in a televised statement.If Yoon is impeached, he’ll be stripped of his constitutional powers until the Constitutional Court rules. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the No. 2 position in the South Korean government, would take over his presidential responsibilities. As calls mounted for Yoon’s Cabinet to resign, Han issued a public message pleading for patience and calling for Cabinet members to “fulfill your duties even after this moment.”The Constitutional Court has only six justices following three retirements, which is one below the minimum seven needed to handle a presidential impeachment case, requiring lawmakers to speed up the process of naming new justices.Yoon’s martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, harkened to South Korea’s past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed martial law and other decrees that allowed them to station combat soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or at public places like schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Such scenes of military intervention had not been seen since South Korea achieved a genuine democracy in the late 1980s until Tuesday night.After Yoon’s declaration, troops carrying full battle gear, including assault rifles, tried to keep protesters away from the National Assembly as military helicopters flew overhead and landed nearby. One soldier pointed his assault rifle at a woman who was among protesters outside the building demanding that the martial law be lifted.It wasn’t clear how the 190 lawmakers were able to enter a parliamentary hall to vote down Yoon’s martial law decree. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung livestreamed himself climbing over the wall, and while troops and police officers blocked some from entering they didn’t aggressively restrain or use force against others.No major violence has been reported. The troops and police personnel were later seen leaving the grounds of the National Assembly after the parliamentary vote to lift the martial law. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said: “Even with our unfortunate memories of military coups, our citizens have surely observed the events of today and saw the maturity of our military.”Han, the People Power Party leader, demanded that Yoon explain his decision and fire Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who he said recommended the martial law decree to Yoon. The Defense Ministry has not commented.Under South Korea’s constitution, the president can declare martial law during “wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states” that require the use of military force to restrict the freedom of press, assembly and other rights to maintain order. Many observers question whether South Korea is currently in such a state.The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.Some experts say Yoon clearly violated the constitution in how he imposed martial law. While martial law allows “special measures” to restrict individual freedoms and the authority of agencies and courts, the constitution does not permit the functions of parliament to be restricted. But in following Yoon’s declaration on Tuesday, South Korea’s military proclaimed parliamentary activities were suspended and deployed troops to try to block lawmakers from entering the National Assembly.Park Chan-dae, the Democratic Party’s floor leader, called for Yoon to be immediately investigated on charges of rebellion over the way he deployed troops to the parliament. While the president mostly enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to alleged rebellion or treason.In Washington, the White House said the U.S. was “seriously concerned” by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden’s administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement and was in contact with the South Korean government.Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the more than 27,000 U.S. service members based in South Korea.In Seoul, the streets seemed busy like a normal day Wednesday.Tourist Stephen Rowan, from Brisbane, Australia, who was touring Gyeongbokgung Palace, said he was not concerned at all.“But then again, I don’t understand too much about the political status in Korea,” he said. “But I hear they are now calling for the current president’s resignation, so ... apparently there’s going to be a lot of demonstrations. ... I would have been concerned if martial law had stayed enforced.”Yoon’s government and ruling party have been embroiled in an impasse with the Democratic Party over next year’s budget bill and a Democratic Party-led attempt to to impeach three top prosecutors.Natalia Slavney, research analyst at the Stimson Center’s 38 North website that focuses on Korean affairs, said Yoon’s imposition of martial law was “a serious backslide of democracy” that followed a “worrying trend of abuse” since he took office in 2022.South Korea “has a robust history of political pluralism and is no stranger to mass protests and swift impeachments,” Slavney said, citing the example of former President Park Geun-hye, who was removed from office and imprisoned for bribery and other crimes in 2017. She was later pardoned.___Associated Press writer Jennifer McDermott contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 07:23 PM EST",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Drug Enforcement Administration has declined the role after Republican lawmakers blasted him for taking COVID measures seriously during the height of the pandemic in 2020.Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister, a Florida Republican, said in a statement Tuesday that he had decided to drop out after the “gravity of this very important responsibility set in.” “To have been nominated to serve as Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is the honor of a lifetime,” Chronister said in a statement. “Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I’ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.”Trump picked Chronister ― who has worked in the sheriff’s office for more than 30 years in the Tampa area ― on Saturday. Chronister has been elected three times to his current position as sheriff for Hillsborough County, The New York Times reported.According to The Times, Chronister has “virtually no experience with the complex international investigations for which the [DEA] is known.” Chronister’s fellow conservatives also pushed back against his nomination over his actions during the coronavirus pandemic.Following Trump’s announcement, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said on Sunday that Chronister should be “disqualified” for ordering the arrest of a megachurch pastor who defied the 2020 COVID lockdowns by holding a church service. Charges against the pastor were later dropped.“I’m going to call ’em like I see ’em,” Massie posted on X. “Trump’s nominee for head of DEA should be disqualified for ordering the arrest [of] a pastor who defied COVID lockdowns.”And Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) told Fox News, “We don’t need authoritarians who refuse to use discretion and protect the Constitution - no matter which party is in power.”Following Chronister’s announcement, Massie posted on X that he was happy with the decision.“Glad to see him withdraw from consideration,” Massie said. “Next time politicians lose their ever-lovin minds, he can redeem himself by following the Constitution.”",

    "text": "Mehmet Oz, the television-personality doctor and Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, pitched herbal supplements and other products to his millions of social media followers without properly disclosing that he had a business relationship with the company selling them, according to a letter published Tuesday. Oz’s undisclosed ads may have broken influencer marketing rules, the watchdog group Public Citizen wrote to the Federal Trade Commission. Specifically, Oz is a “global advisor and stakeholder” with iHerb, which sells everything from vitamins and supplements to pet food. And though he makes that disclosure on his X and Instagram profile pages, Oz doesn’t mention anything about his connection to iHerb in the actual videos he posts about its products on social media, as required by FTC rules. Oz pitched iHerb’s ashwagandha capsules just a few days ago, iHerb multivitamins a few days prior, and in October, he urged followers to “create a healthy foundation to defend against Halloween excesses with California Gold’s multivitamin & mineral” and plugged “exclusive discounts” for the company, which he called “my trusted source,” all without disclosing his actual business relationship to iHerb on the individual videos. In September, he plugged iHerb’s “daily deals” on products like Life Extension, “NAD+ Cell Regenerator” supplement and pecans. “My friends, living your best life is easy to achieve when you shop at iHerb,” Trump’s pick to lead CMS said. “[Oz’s] video posts do not disclose his financial connections, nor does the accompanying text. Nor do the posts contain other disclosures such as #ad,” said the Public Citizen letter, addressed to the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. It noted past warnings sent to other influencers over similar issues and urged the bureau to investigate whether Oz had violated FTC policy on undisclosed endorsements and product advertisements, and to “take appropriate action.” “As you know, a longstanding, core principle of fair advertising law in the United States is that people have a right to know when they are being advertised to,” Public Citizen’s co-president Robert Weissman wrote. The letter noted guidance from the FTC last year concerning the application of the FTC Act — which governs “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce” — to the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising. The guidance gave the example of an influencer “who is paid to endorse a vitamin product in their social media posts [and] discloses their connection to the product’s manufacturer only on the profile pages of their social media accounts.”“The disclosure is not clear and conspicuous because people seeing their paid posts could easily miss the disclosure,” the guidance said.“The logic of this rule is clear,” Weissman wrote. “Because most people will miss the disclosure in the profile page, that disclosure does not adequately inform consumers and enable them to contextualize the advertisement they are seeing as an advertisement.”The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment about the Public Citizen letter.Oz’s potential conflicts of interest and his promotion of drugs, supplements and medical devices as a television host and social media personality could complicate his potential job in the Trump administration, as the The Washington Post and New York Times have detailed in recent days. During a Senate hearing in 2014, for example, Oz acknowledged that claims about products he’d featured on his show “don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact,” but said he personally believed in them anyway.And in 2019, Oz did a glowing segment on the weight-loss drug Ozempic, in which he mentioned the drug’s manufacturer, “trusted partner” Novo Nordisk. The company acknowledged sponsoring the segment to the Post, but said it didn’t have an ongoing relationship with Oz. The Post noted Oz still promotes the drug on his website, as well as another drug, iHerb’s Collagen-Up, which he describes as an answer to sagging skin resulting from weight loss, which has been called “Ozempic face.” If he does ultimately lead the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Oz could play a role in answering the open question of whether the federal government should cover weight-loss medicine for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries — particularly if the drugs help overweight patients with noncosmetic weight issues like heart problems and diabetes. “It’s a big battle happening now” over insurance coverage for Wegovy, another weight-loss drug, Oz said in a video last November. “I think Medicare is going to be the real finish line. Are they going to cover weight-loss drugs? They’re not allowed to, by law, but Wegovy appears to do more than just help with weight loss.” A Trump transition spokesperson told the Post that “all nominees and appointees will comply with the ethical obligations of their respective agencies.”",

    "author": "S.V. Date",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 06:29 PM EST",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — When Americans elected a coup-attempting, sexually abusing, fraud-committing criminal as president, did they by that choice also lower the bar for those serving in his administration?As they prepare to go before the U.S. Senate for confirmation, Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Kash Patel, Matt Gaetz — until Gaetz withdrew from consideration — and others have been facing questions over their previous actions and words that have raised doubts about their fitness for the job.Yet in every case, the man who appointed them, President-elect Donald Trump, has done or said things far more egregious during his previous term in office and over his subsequent three-and-a-half-year effort to return to the White House. American voters narrowly returned him to office anyway — meaning senators will now have to decide whether Trump’s appointees should be held to a higher standard than Trump himself.“This question breaks my heart,” said Jennifer Horn, the former chair of New Hampshire’s Republican Party who broke from Trump soon after he was first elected in 2016.Trump campaign and transition officials did not respond to HuffPost’s queries.Critics of Trump’s choice for defense secretary point to allegations of Hegseth’s treatment of women, including an allegation he raped a woman in 2017, in an encounter Hegseth has said was consensual. Yet Trump himself was found by a New York jury to have sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll by digitally penetrating her in a department store – an act that the trial judge pointed out was considered rape in many jurisdictions.Democrats and some Republicans argue that Tulsi Gabbard’s defense of Syrian dictator and alleged war criminal Bashar Assad and Russian dictator Vladimir Putin should disqualify her from serving as Director of National Intelligence. Trump, though, knowingly used Russian help to win the 2016 election, famously said he believed Putin over his own intelligence community, and to this day praises Putin, even calling him a genius for having invaded Ukraine.And while Patel has aggressively spread lies and conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and promised vengeance against Trump’s critics, Trump himself is the prime mover behind the violence of Jan. 6, 2021, without whom the day would have passed without notice. Throughout his 2024 campaign, he has vowed revenge against the justice system that tried to hold him to account.“The fact that Donald Trump has been re-elected is a devastating blow to democracy, and his nominees for the highest positions in government are a reflection of that,” Horn said. “But whether or not these unqualified, Putin advocates are actually seated lies in the hands of the Senate. If they are accepted, it will be a measure of the character and integrity of each Republican senator.”Whether the Senate will hold Trump’s appointees to a higher standard than voters held Trump himself could be in the hands of a small group of Republican senators who have never been great fans of the man who took over their party over the past decade.Erick Erickson, a conservative radio talk show host who supported Trump, despite misgivings, on the belief that American democracy is stronger than Trump, said the Senate needs to evaluate appointees based on what it believes is good for the country.“The president is chosen by an Electoral College selected by the people. His appointees are confirmed by a Senate, some of whom were chosen in 2020, some of whom were chosen in 2022, and some of whom were chosen in 2024, all of whom have their own standards and opinions, which may or may not be the same as the people who support Trump,” he said. “The Constitution still matters and remains a robust check on the powers of all three branches of government.”The prevailing theory on presidential appointments, generally shared by both Democrats and Republicans, is that presidents should be able to have the leadership team of their choosing. That, however, has been tempered by senators’ desire not to give a president a blank check.In 1992, senators forced Democratic president Bill Clinton’s first two choices for attorney general, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, to withdraw after revelations that they had hired undocumented immigrants to care for their children.Thirty-two years later, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump’s attorney general pick after Republican senators said they expected to see a still-secret House Ethics Committee report that reportedly details Gaetz’s payments to a 17-year-old girl for allegedly having sex with him at a drug-fueled party. Gaetz has denied he did anything wrong or illegal.Gaetz, in any event, has not been found liable for sexual abuse by a jury following a trial, as Trump has. Nor was he described by notorious accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein as his “closest friend,” as Trump was.How hard Republican senators, a number of whom were publicly warning against Gaetz’s nomination, will push against some of the others is unclear.At the Capitol Tuesday, Utah’s newly elected John Curtis, like many of his GOP colleagues, largely avoided questions about specific nominees but agreed that Trump’s wishes mattered a great deal. “He gets a lot of deference,” Curtis said.Others, though, made clear they believed Trump deserves complete deference. Idaho’s Michael Crapo said he was fine with whatever Trump wants, even if he submits names that have not undergone an FBI background check, as has traditionally been done prior to receiving a security clearance. “My position is what President Trump decides to do is what I will support,” he told reporters on Monday.George Conway, who supported Trump’s candidacy in 2016 and was briefly considering a job in his first administration but has since become a vocal critic, said he doubts Senate leaders will have much appetite for a fight with Trump.“What they should do and what they will do will be different,” he said. “I think they may try to torpedo a couple of them and call it a day.”To former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh, who also turned against Trump early in his first term, the very idea of rejecting Trump’s nominees for behaviors that Americans have made clear they are OK with in Trump is absurd.“There should be no objections. Pete Hegseth is Donald Trump. Tulsi Gabbard is Donald Trump. Kash Patel is Donald Trump,” Walsh said.“And when it comes to any of these nominees who couldn’t pass an FBI background check,” he added, “we need to remember this: Trump couldn’t pass an FBI background check either.”Trump was convicted in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to a porn star just before the 2016 election. The judge in the case has repeatedly postponed sentencing and now wants to hear arguments from Trump and the New York state prosecutors about whether he should dismiss the case because Trump won the presidential election.Federal felony charges against Trump based on his actions leading up to and during his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt and for refusing to return secret documents he took with him to his South Florida country club have already been dismissed based on Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president.Jennifer Bendery contributed to this report.",

    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 08:15 PM EST",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys currently serving 22 years for seditious conspiracy, to appear for possible testimony in the trial of Shane Lamond, a former D.C. Metropolitan Police lieutenant facing multiple felony charges for allegedly obstructing a probe into the Proud Boys and repeatedly lying to investigators.Lamond’s defense lawyers want Tarrio to testify at the bench trial because they argue it will prove that Lamond’s communication with Tarrio after the 2020 election was part of the lieutenant’s official duties as leader of the police department’s intelligence division. Federal prosecutors, however, say the relationship between Tarrio and Lamond was corrupt. U.S. attorneys argue Lamond was a Proud Boys sympathizer who worked as a “double agent” at the department. Lamond, who is charged with obstruction of justice and making multiple false statements, is accused of passing information to Tarrio about a police probe into the Proud Boys and the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner on Dec. 12, 2020. Tarrio has pleaded guilty to burning the banner and was sentenced to five months in prison. He was also convicted on seditious conspiracy charges last year, and is now serving a 22-year prison sentence — to date, the longest sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Presiding U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said Tuesday that she wants Tarrio transferred from prison to her courtroom by Wednesday afternoon. Prosecutors may rest their case against Lamond at that time and formally turn the floor over to the defense. On Tuesday, Lamond, clean cut and sporting a gray suit, spent most of the day sitting next to his lawyers, chatting quietly with them as U.S. attorney Rebecca Ross pulled up text after text for the judge. Ross argued that the messages, which were sent between November 2020 and January 2021, showed a friendly and steady repartee between Tarrio and Lamond that only grew in the weeks after Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. On the night the 2020 election was called for President Joe Biden, for example, Lamond texted Tarrio to check in. “Hey brother,” he wrote on Nov. 7, 2020. “Sad, sad news today. You all planning anything?”Tarrio replied with a picture showing he was out off-roading.“Nice. Wish I was there instead of here. Let me know if you do anything later,” Lamond replied. Before Nov. 7, Tarrio and Lamond primarily spoke through unencrypted text channels and rarely used Telegram or Telegram’s private chat feature to connect. Of roughly 280 messages the men shared prior to Nov. 7, most were sent via SMS/text, according to testimony heard Tuesday from an FBI special agent. Tarrio attended a pro-Trump rally in Washington, D.C., on Dec. 12, 2020. Prosecutors said Proud Boys members stole a Black Lives Matter banner from a church the night after the rally, then set it on fire. Tarrio posted a photo of himself on the far-right social media site Parler holding an unlit lighter; he later admitted online to destroying the banner. The rally turned violent that night and led to multiple stabbings. Proud Boys member Jeremy Bertino, who pleaded guilty to seditious conspiracy in October 2022 for his conduct on Jan. 6, was among those who were stabbed. Tensions were high the next night too, with Proud Boys beginning to voice their distrust and frustration with police.Ross showed the judge texts showing Lamond had reached out to Tarrio after Bertino’s stabbing. On Dec. 12, he told the Proud Boys leader that “on a brighter note,” police had locked up the person who stabbed Bertino. The following day, Tarrio asked Lamond outright for his assessment of how D.C. police actually viewed the Proud Boys, according to texts shown by prosecutors. That answer, Lamond wrote, was “too complicated” for a text message. The men agreed to meet at a local bar. Other records showed that when Lamond told his supervisor at the time, Carolyn Montagna, about the meetup, she replied: “Eek. Is that smart to do social?”Lamond assured her it was. A day after that meeting, Tarrio fired off texts to Proud Boys in which he lamented that he may be going to jail for a hate crime after talking to “his guy” at the department. At the time, police were investigating whether to enhance Tarrio’s destruction of property charge with a hate crime charge. They ultimately did not. The first secret chat Lamond opened with Tarrio on Telegram, Ross said, only came after police received a crime solvers tip online claiming Tarrio was responsible for burning the BLM banner. Lamond asked Tarrio if he had submitted the tip on himself, and Tarrio said he had done more than that: He admitted to burning the banner on social media. Other texts revealed Tuesday showed Tarrio boasting to other Proud Boys that his confession to the crime allowed Proud Boys to “[get] the jump” on the “hate crime narrative” in the press. The group, which espouses Western chauvinist values, claims it is not a racist organization largely by pointing to the diversity of its membership, including Tarrio, who is Latino. In an email to his supervisors in late 2020, Lamond said the Proud Boys organization wasn’t racist. Lamond told Tarrio he had shared this opinion with higher-ups at the department. He also told Tarrio he advocated against bringing the hate crime enhancement because, as he told his supervisors, if Tarrio were going to be charged with a hate crime for burning the BLM banner, then all Trump flags or banners taken by “antifa” would have to be investigated as a hate crime. “Ah ok awesome,” Tarrio replied to Lamond. Tarrio took a screenshot of Lamond’s text and passed the message along to Proud Boys group chats. As Jan. 6, 2021, approached, according to texts Ross showed the judge, Lamond informed Tarrio that police wanted to interview him about the burning of the banner. Prosecutors showed that several audio files — which are now unrecoverable — had been shared between Lamond and Tarrio and then later deleted. Some of the calls lasted just seconds. One call lasted up to 28 minutes.Ross pointed out to the judge that records show Lamond and Tarrio talked at least 24 times for over a minute before Tarrio was finally arrested on Jan. 4, 2021. Notably, Lamond told detectives drafting Tarrio’s warrant that he had only seen Tarrio five or six times, Ross said. And he never mentioned all of the discussions he had with Tarrio outside of those meetings, MPD Lieutenant Ahsan Mufti testified on Monday.During the Proud Boys seditious conspiracy trial, prosecutors argued that Tarrio used his arrest for the burning of the BLM banner as an alibi for his whereabouts on Jan. 6. He could not have been at the Capitol because he was ordered out of Washington, D.C. Instead, he watched from a hotel room in Baltimore, Maryland, as the insurrection was carried out. Texts Ross showed Tuesday also suggested Tarrio was feeling the pressure to get to D.C. as he awaited word from Lamond on whether an arrest warrant had been approved. He had already bought his airline tickets. “If I walk into the station on the 4th, they will have no choice but to pick me up,” Tarrio wrote in a message to another Proud Boy before boarding the flight to D.C. Records showed the warrant had been issued by the time Tarrio got on the plane, and texts show that Lamond changed a self-destruct timer on his chats with Tarrio once the Proud Boys leader was en route, Ross told the judge. Instead of self-deleting every 30 seconds, they began to disappear after just 10 seconds.",

    "text": "Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) urged President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to take action in their last weeks in office to try to prevent incoming President Donald Trump from siccing the military on the U.S. public.In a letter dated Sunday, the pair emphasized that failing to provide legal guidance could lead to turmoil within the armed forces.Trump has said that he would order the U.S. military to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in his plans to deport immigrants lacking permanent legal status — an unprecedented action that critics regard as an affront to personal liberties. He’s also discussed using the armed forces against perceived enemies, suggesting before the Nov. 5 election that the military should be deployed against “radical-left lunatics” if necessary.The Democratic senators suggested that Biden issue a policy directive outlining limitations on the president’s authority to use the military to enforce civilian law. There are already rules in place. A post-Reconstruction law, the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, states that use of any part of the armed forces “to execute the laws” is punishable by a fine or imprisonment, except “in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.”But the Insurrection Act provides a loophole of sorts. Under that law, the president can deploy the military against Americans in certain emergency situations that are not fully explained; the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive nonprofit, called the wording “dangerously vague.” Trump has suggested that he would immediately declare a national emergency over what he terms an “invasion” by immigrants, paving the way for him to mobilize the military on U.S. soil.In their letter, Warren and Blumenthal said the policy directive should state that use of the Insurrection Act is limited to very narrow circumstances in which state or local authorities are “overwhelmed,” and “that the President must consult with Congress to the maximum extent practicable” before ordering the military to take action. Troops would also need to comply with bedrock principles of the criminal justice system such as the writ of habeas corpus, or a person’s right to be brought to court for a formal ruling on their detention, the pair said.The senators urged Biden and Austin to act swiftly in light of the Supreme Court’s recent presidential immunity decision, which significantly expanded a president’s ability to act without fear of later being prosecuted.They pointed to unresolved questions about the real-world implications of that decision.“While the president may be immune, legal scholars have said this decision should not have any impact on service members’ obligation to reject unlawful orders,” Warren and Blumenthal wrote.“Given the disagreement amongst scholars on the serious implications of the recent Supreme Court decision, it is reasonable to assume that service members, other DoD [Department of Defense] personnel, and the broader military community may not be aware of or fully understand their rights and responsibilities,” they said.“If unaddressed, any ambiguity on the lawful use of military force, coupled with President-elect Trump’s demonstrated intent to utilize the military in such dangerous and unprecedented ways, may prove to be devastating.”Pentagon officials have already started discussing how to respond to a situation in which Trump issues a controversial order, CNN reported last month.“Troops are compelled by law to disobey unlawful orders,” one defense official told the outlet. “But the question is what happens then – do we see resignations from senior military leaders? Or would they view that as abandoning their people?”",

    "title": "South Korea Chaos: Lifts President’s Martial Law Decree After Lawmakers Reject Military Rule",
    "author": "",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 09:23 AM EST",
    "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The president of South Korea early Wednesday lifted the martial law he imposed on the country hours earlier, bending to political pressure after a tense night in which troops surrounded parliament and lawmakers voted to reject military rule.President Yoon Suk Yeol, who appeared likely to be impeached over his actions, imposed martial law late Tuesday out of frustration with the opposition, vowing to eliminate “anti-state” forces as he struggles against opponents who control parliament and that he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.Police and military personnel were seen leaving the grounds of parliament following the bipartisan vote to overrule the president, and the declaration was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting.Parliament acted swiftly after martial law was imposed, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that the law was “invalid” and that lawmakers would “protect democracy with the people.”In all, martial law was in effect for about six hours.The president’s surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon’s own conservative party.Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party’s lawmakers would remain in the Assembly’s main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.Woo applauded how troops quickly left the Assembly after the vote.“Even with our unfortunate memories of military coups, our citizens have surely observed the events of today and saw the maturity of our military,” Woo said.While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament’s attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. He said lawmakers had engaged in “unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.”Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker, claimed that security camera footage following Yoon’s declaration showed that troops moved in a way that suggested they were trying to arrest Lee, Woo and even Han Dong-hoon, the leader of Yoon’s People Power Party.Officials from Yoon’s office and the Defense Ministry did not respond to requests for comment early Wednesday.Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon’s impeachment.Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers’ vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting “Aren’t you embarrassed?”Under South Korea’s constitution, the president can declare martial law during “wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states” that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.When martial law is declared, “special measures” can be employed to restrict freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.Following Yoon’s announcement of martial law, South Korea’s military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause “social confusion” would be suspended, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said. The military said anyone who violated the decree could be arrested without a warrant.In Washington, the White House said the U.S. was “seriously concerned” by the events in Seoul. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said President Joe Biden’s administration was not notified in advance of the martial law announcement and was in contact with the South Korean government.Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the more than 27,000 U.S. service members based in South Korea.The South Korean military also said that the country’s striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools.Soon after martial law was declared, the parliament speaker called on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to “remain calm and hold their positions.All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law.At one point, television footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building. An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.The leader of Yoon’s conservative party called the decision to impose martial law “wrong.” Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, said Yoon’s announcement was “illegal and unconstitutional.”Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help “rebuild and protect” the country from “falling into the depths of national ruin.” He said he would “eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.”“I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,” he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate “some inconveniences.”Yoon — whose approval rating dipped in recent months — has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.His party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year’s budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the central Seoul prosecutors’ office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.During his televised announcement, Yoon also described the opposition as “shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces who are plundering the freedom and happiness of our citizens.” He did not elaborate.Yoon has taken a hard line on North Korea over its nuclear ambitions, departing from the policies of his liberal predecessor, Moon Jae-in, who pursued inter-Korean engagement.Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals.Yoon’s move was the first declaration of martial law since the country’s democratization in 1987. The country’s last previous martial law was in October 1979, following the assassination of former military dictator Park Chung-hee.Sydney Seiler, Korean chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that the move was symbolic for Yoon to express his frustration with the opposition-controlled parliament.“He has nothing to lose,” said Seiler, comparing Yoon’s move to the Hail Mary pass in American football, with a slim chance of success.Now Yoon faces likely impeachment, a scenario that was also possible before he made the bold move, Seiler said.Natalia Slavney, research analyst at the Stimson Center’s 38 North website that focuses on Korean affairs, said Yoon’s imposition of martial law was “a serious backslide of democracy” that followed a “worrying trend of abuse” since he took office in 2022.South Korea “has a robust history of political pluralism and is no stranger to mass protests and swift impeachments,” Slavney said, citing the example of former President Park Geun-hye, the country’s first female president, who was ousted from office and imprisoned for bribery and other crimes in 2017.___Associated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, and Matt Lee, Didi Tang and Tara Copp in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "author": "Nina Golgowski",

    "text": "For the second time this year, the federal government has issued a fine over the use of child labor to clean a pork processing plant in the Midwest.Th U.S. Labor Department on Friday announced that Oklahoma’s Qvest LLC must pay nearly $172,000 in civil money penalties, after the government accused the sanitation company of violating the Fair Labor Standards Act through the employment of 11 children at the Seaboard Triumph Foods pork factory in Sioux City, Iowa.The minors were tasked with using “corrosive cleaners to clean head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment” from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the Labor Department said.Back in May, a different cleaning company was fined more than $649,000 for using underage workers at the same Sioux City plant, as well as at a separate meat processing facility in Virginia.“These findings illustrate Seaboard Triumph Foods’ history of children working illegally in their Sioux City facility since at least September 2019,” Michael Lazzeri, the Midwest regional administrator for the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division, said in Friday’s announcement. “Despite changing sanitation contractors, children continued to work in dangerous occupations at this facility.”In addition to the fine, Qvest must hire a third-party consultant or compliance specialist to ensure enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act’s child labor provisions. All management personnel must receive child labor compliance training, and employees must be provided access to a toll-free number that they can call to request guidance or report compliance issues on an anonymous basis.Representatives for both Qvest and Seaboard Triumph Foods told HuffPost that no minors were knowingly hired at the Sioux City facility, and that the issue was likely the result of a nationwide problem of people using fraudulent identification documents to obtain employment.“We have absolutely no interest in having any employees that are under the age of 18 and the company has worked diligently to ensure our hiring process is structured to be in compliance with this standard,” Adam Greer, Qvest’s vice president of operations, said in a statement.Greer added that Qvest has not been able to confirm any of the Labor Department’s accusations, saying that federal officials have not shared “any names or specific information related to the alleged violations.” Despite this, he said that the company agrees with the government’s efforts to combat child labor and that Qvest has expanded its human resources staff and the training given to hiring personnel for confirming work eligibility.“While there is always a chance that future candidates may attempt to use fraudulent documentation, we are encouraged by how our improved detection measures are working now,” Greer said.A spokesperson for Seaboard Triumph Foods similarly said that it “has no evidence that any underage individuals accessed the plant” and stressed that the Labor Department’s complaint does not accuse the company of any wrongdoing.In a separate statement from Seaboard Triumph Foods, Paul DeCamp, who previously led the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division and now acts as legal counsel for the foods company, also criticized individuals’ ability to use fake documentation to “fool even the federal government’s E-Verify system,” a database for confirming employment eligibility.“Businesses are victimized by this fraud,” he said.",

Fuck that guy. Daniel Cray-ig? I’m so sorry. Please accept my apology.”Craig has appeared on the “Late Show” nearly every other year since 2015 and is currently promoting Luca Guadagnino’s adaptation of William S. Burrough’s “Queer,” which follows an alcoholic American expat in 1950s Mexico City who grows infatuated with another man.While currently only available in a limited release, and despite the film only expanding nationwide in February, the trades are already buzzing about Craig’s chances at the upcoming Oscars — and wagering that he could receive his first-ever nod for Best Actor.See his full exchange with Colbert here:",

    "text": "Jude Law just made another surprising admission about his hit Christmas film, “The Holiday.” While appearing on an episode of SiriusXM’s “The Jess Cagle Show with Julia Cunningham” that was released Tuesday, the actor revealed the valid reason why he’s never watched the 2006 rom-com with his children despite its massive popularity.Law stars as Cameron Diaz’s love interest in “The Holiday,” which follows two lovesick women who unexpectedly find love while on vacation after swapping homes with each other.The conversation kicked off after host Jess Cagle asked Law if “people just constantly” approach him in public about the film since it’s “become a Christmas classic.” “It really has. ... The idea that people revisit a piece of work is honestly nothing short of a phenomenon to me, and for the first few years, I was always sort of startled,” the British star said.“I just find it so delightful. I’m thrilled,” he added. Law then admitted that he doesn’t “join” his fans in watching the movie annually for the holiday season because “it’s not my family Christmas movie.” “But it should be. Don’t your kids want to see ‘The Holiday’?” Cagle asked.“See Dad and Cameron [Diaz]? I’m not sure,” Law, a father of seven, said with a laugh, prompting Cagle to jokingly respond, “Oh, I forgot about that. Never mind.”According to People magazine, Law is a father to: Rafferty, Iris and Rudy with ex-wife Sadie Frost; Sophia with ex-girlfriend Samantha Burke; Ada with ex-girlfriend Catherine Harding; and two children (whose names have not been shared publicly) with current wife Phillipa Coan.The “Eden” star disclosed another surprising fact regarding “The Holiday” late last month. During an interview with BBC Radio, Law confessed that the Rosehill cottage that’s prominently featured in the film doesn’t actually exist.He also revealed that the cottage interior scenes in the movie weren’t filmed in the charming English countryside and were instead shot in Los Angeles, saying, “Every time I’d go in that door, we’d cut, and we shot the interiors in LA about three months later.”",

Oh my God, did you break in?” Grande asked.Barrymore said everyone on the show was “so excited about you coming here” that they all decided, “‘OK, let’s get the wand.’”“That is the original wand from ‘The Wizard of Oz.’ So there you go,” she explained.Grande still appeared overwhelmed and could only say, “Oh my God.”The segment officially airs Thursday, but you can get a taste of it in the Instagram video below.",

    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 09:19 PM EST",
    "text": "The husband of a missing Virginia nurse has been formally charged with killing her and hiding her body, thanks to new DNA evidence.Naresh Bhatt was indicted by a grand jury on Monday on charges of first-degree murder and physically defiling a dead body in connection to the disappearance of his wife, 28-year-old Mamta Kafle Bhatt, Manassas Park Police announced at a press conference on Monday. Her remains have still not been found. Authorities say Mamta Bhatt was last seen at her job at UVA Health Prince William Medical Center in Manassas on July 27. Her coworkers became concerned when she didn’t show up for a scheduled shift. During a welfare check on the Bhatts’ home on Aug. 2, Naresh Bhatt told police he had last seen his wife on July 31, but said he didn’t want to report her missing, according to an earlier press release. He waited until Aug. 5, per police. Naresh told officers that Mamta had destroyed her phone before leaving their home to see family in New York or Texas, ABC affiliate WJLA reported at the time.However, detectives learned that she did not have relatives in those states, and on Monday, Manassas Police Chief Mario Lugo told reporters that evidence suggests that she was actually killed on July 29. In an interview with WUSA9 in August, Naresh Bhatt claimed she had previously gone missing and returned. He pleaded for her to come back and described his sadness over her disappearance. “She’s a special person for me because she’s caring and loving,” Naresh Bhatt told the outlet.He was arrested days later, on Aug. 22. Initially, he was charged with concealing a dead body; he now faces charges of killing Mamta and defiling her corpse.Authorities searched the couple’s home and found blood and other evidence suggesting a body had been dragged from the bedroom to the bathroom. The blood matched Mamta Bhatt’s DNA, Lugo said on Monday.“The forensic unit of Prince William County said it was one of the worst crime scenes they’ve seen,” Lugo told reporters on Monday.After his arrest, Naresh Bhatt was denied bond and has remained in jail since. He has not yet entered a plea, and the public defender’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Prosecutors who spoke at Naresh Bhatt’s earlier arraignment on the concealing a body charge told the court that he had made internet searches on his work laptop in April including “How long does it take to get married after spouse die,” and “What happen to debt died spouse,” WUSA9 reported. They also reportedly said he had sold his Tesla only a few days before his arrest, and was attempting to sell his home.He was seen at a Walmart buying a pack of knives on July 30, then returned to a different Walmart location to buy cleaning supplies, prosecutors said, according to ABC affiliate WJLA.Lugo declined on Monday to speculate about how exactly Mamta died. “I just know that whatever happened in that house, it was murder,” he said.Gita Kafle, the Mamta Bhatt’s mother, told WUSA9 that her “heart is hurt.”“She was a person who was very hardworking, very beautiful, very honest. She aspired to be somebody great, and she worked really hard,” Kafle said. “I don’t know what to say because I can never forget her, but whenever I think about it, I have my heartache.”The case joins a relatively small but growing list of homicide cases that have gone to trial even before a body was found. Tad DiBiase, a former federal homicide prosecutor, previously told HuffPost that advances in forensics have made it easier to prosecute these kinds of crimes.Dive deep into true crime cases and follow the latest headlines with HuffPost’s Suspicious Circumstances newsletter.

    "text": "Looks like Timothée Chalamet is a really good guy, according to the man who organized a look-alike contest dedicated to the “Wonka” star.Back in October, the Oscar-nominated heartthrob delighted fans when he showed up at a contest in lower Manhattan dedicated to finding the person who most looked like him.The event drew hundreds of onlookers besides Chalamet, which led to police ordering the crowd to disperse.Four people were arrested at the event for being at an “unscheduled demonstration,” and organizers were also given a $500 fine for holding an “unpermitted costume contest.”Organizer Anthony Po told People that the fine was actually a best-case scenario, since it meant authorities would need to “do something stronger” if they want to prevent further lookalike gatherings. Po said Chalamet continued to show his support even after the event was over. He said the actor’s reps reached out to him and “offered to pay the ticket, which is truly funny.”He said that while he appreciated Chalamet’s offer, he declined to take the money, instead allowing Partiful, a digital invite app, to pay the fine instead.But Po was happy to hear that Chalamet enjoyed the event held in his honor, he told People. He didn’t get to meet Chalamet, but the actor was included in the contest’s final rankings — in 13th place.“I think if he would’ve stayed for the end of it, maybe I would’ve given him runner-up or something,” Po said, noting that Chalamet currently has a mustache, and that set him apart from the other curly-haired, clean-shaven contestants.The actual runner-up, Zander Dueve, did see Chalamet at the contest and told People, “He looked the least like himself out of everyone.”Chalamet’s latest movie, the Bob Dylan biopic “A Complete Unknown,” opens Dec. 25.",

    "title": "This Artist Is Weaving Her Indigenous Ancestry Into Meaningful Wearable Artwork",
    "author": "Kate Nelson",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 03:57 PM EST",
    "text": "Rhiannon Griego’s light- and energy-filled studio in Santa Fe is her happy place. Sometimes, she’ll find herself there vibing for 14 hours straight, just conceptualizing and weaving. To prepare her work environment each morning, the Native American textile artist first sweeps to allow for a clean space and an intentionally clear mind. She then puts on some music to create the day’s mood and burns some incense before she settles in behind her loom.  For Griego, weaving is more than merely a means of creative expression or a hustle; it’s a way to connect with her multicultural Tohono O’odham, Mexican, and Spanish heritage. She picked up the practice in 2013 and since then, felt more and more compelled to help preserve the ancient Indigenous cultural tradition. “There are still many Tohono O’odham basket weavers, but the art form of weaving garments began to die out two centuries ago,” says Griego. “My process of reconnecting [to my Native heritage] is also about rekindling something that has been lost. It really feels like an interweaving of all of who I am.”Her designs — tops, tunics, dresses, scarves and wall hangings — are made with natural, sustainable materials and often embody a memory, represent a feeling, or reflect the natural world around her. The practice, she shares, is at once fulfilling and taxing.“Weaving is a very spiritual practice, but it’s also very physically demanding,” she explains. “It requires strength, stamina, stillness and focus. It has taught me a lot of patience and instructed me on being grounded.” Griego tells me that when she finds herself in stressful situations, she’s learned to find that place of stillness that she’s honed — and that anchor has been an unexpected benefit of the craft. Griego rarely sketches out her designs ahead of time and instead lets her intuition take the lead. A single piece can take up to 70 hours to make, often spread out over weeks or even months. For instance, one recently debuted collection features 42 garments and has been a solid 10 months in the making. “This collection is really about the metaphor that embers represent,” Griego tells me. “When we see a fire going out, do we let it extinguish or do we reignite it? It’s predominantly woven with different shades of brown, charcoal, gray and cream to reflect the ash and the subtle embers one would see when a fire is collapsing.”Griego’s designs feature natural, durable materials such as wool, organic cotton, silk, linen, hemp, bamboo, and even some uncommon fibers such as agave, yucca and horsehair. That materiality reflects not only the time-honored traditions of her mixed-race heritage — her Tohono O’odham ancestors used agave and horsehair in their basketweaving, while her Spanish forebears raised churro sheep — but also the feeling she aims to capture for the wearer. “First and foremost, everything is always about feeling,” Griego tells me. “How does this garment make me feel about myself? How do the fibers actually feel on my body? I want everything I weave to leave an imprint on the wearer, collector or admirer.” After all, what we wear is one of the fundamental expressions of not only our values, but how we want to be perceived.Griego’s focus on sustainability is meant to reflect an Indigenous worldview that centers on living in harmony with the natural world rather than exploiting or extracting from it. “It’s mind-blowing how much waste the fashion industry produces and how long of an impact fast fashion has on our environment,” she says. “There’s just something so profound about working with and wearing natural fibers. It immediately connects you to your environment.” Nature is both an inspiration and, at times, a physical workspace for Griego. She’ll occasionally pack up her loom and materials and make her way to an inspiring alfresco setting where she’ll spend the day weaving. Not only is this a soothing change of scenery, but it’s also a reminder of the inherent beauty of the imperfect.“I try to never take things too seriously or confine myself to a rigid way of thinking,” she says. “I don’t aspire to create perfect textiles, either. Sometimes I’ll unravel a woven area or leave raw selvages unruly so there’s something truly unique about every piece. After all, there is so much beauty to be found within the cracks.”No matter what she’s working on, Griego strives for designs that reflect three key principles: elegance, simplicity and versatility. Those guiding lights are evident in all her work, from tie dresses that nod to the aprons her female ancestors donned in the kitchen preparing family meals to the boldness and utility of the menswear she recently crafted for her newest collection.Stylish statement pieces are a happy byproduct of her lifelong journey to better understand her unique Indigeneity. “Growing up, I experienced a lot of trauma and was very insecure because I didn’t understand where I belonged or what I was supposed to be doing,” she shares. “In reconnecting with my O’odham heritage, I’m also trying to revive one of the oldest art forms on the planet…Much as I understand the world to all be interconnected, I, too, am interwoven with multiple cultures.”",

    "text": "On Monday’s “Today” show, hosts Jenna Bush Hager and Hoda Kotb got candid about some of the harsh comments they received early on in their TV careers. “Sometimes people will tell you things you’re not right for,” Kotb recalled.She said she played basketball in high school, so as a young TV reporter, she felt like she was in shape.Kotb’s boss had a less flattering assessment. “I still remember my boss going to me, ‘Hey, Hoda,’ and I was like, ‘Yeah?’ He goes, ‘Hey, I got an idea –– maybe you might wanna try to get on the treadmill.’”“No!” Hager said, shocked.Kotb couldn’t believe it at the time. She added, “If you don’t fit, they want you to wear something a certain way, cut your hair a certain way, speak a certain way.”This prompted Hager to share her own story of being told what to do: A boss once told her not to say the word “y’all” on air. “They were like, ‘Hey, y’all,’ isn’t for the whole country,’” Hager, who was born and raised in Texas, said. “And I was like, ‘Well, but it’s who I am.’“It’s so weird — and this happens in life, too. If you have friends and then, all of a sudden, you’re acting not [like] who you are, and you’re like, ‘Wait,’ something in your gut feels wrong.”Hager and Kotb both agreed that it’s hard to teach your kids to be their authentic selves if you can’t show up as your full self at work.“If you try to pretend to be somebody else, it feels crazy,” Hager said.“I think you know when you’re pretending, no matter what it is — and you start losing like who you are,” Kotb added.December marks Kotb’s last full month with the network. She will be replaced by Craig Melvin early next year.",

    "author": "Jazmin Tolliver",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 05:45 PM EST",
    "text": "Planned Parenthood is capitalizing on the internet’s hype over “Wicked” in a shocking way. The nonprofit organization that provides sexual and reproductive health care and education recently repurposed the musical’s famous Broadway poster — which depicts Glinda whispering into Elphaba’s ear — to dish out a cheeky reminder for people to keep up with their routine testing for sexually transmitted infections.In a post made Monday on Instagram, Planned Parenthood shared the image, changing it to look as if Glinda is asking Elphaba, “Is your discharge green?”“If you’re experiencing wicked sexual and reproductive health care concerns, Planned Parenthood health centers are holding space to help — even if your pussy’s green,” the organization captioned the post.Unsurprisingly, social media users on X, formerly called Twitter, raised an eyebrow over the peculiar ad, with many expressing mixed emotions. Planned Parenthood’s post comes after actor Cynthia Erivo, who stars as Elphaba in the Jon M. Chu-directed film adaptation of “Wicked,” called out a viral fan edit of the movie’s poster, which references the original Broadway one, in October. The altered image attempted to make the poster more like the original by moving the witch hat to partially cover Erivo’s eyes, as well as making her lips red instead of green. Erivo slammed it as “degrading.”“This is the wildest, most offensive thing I have seen, equal to that awful AI of us fighting, equal to people posing the question ‘is your ***** green,’” Erivo wrote in an Oct. 16 Instagram story alongside the fan-made re-creation. “None of this is funny. None of it is cute. It degrades me. It degrades us.”“The original poster is an ILLUSTRATION,” the actor added. “I am a real life human being, who chose to look right down the barrel of the camera to you, the viewer ... because, without words we communicate with our eyes.”“Wicked” is now in theaters. The film’s second part releases Nov. 21, 2025.",

    "title": "Village People Singer Praises Trump For Boosting ‘YMCA,’ Rejects Song’s ‘Gay Anthem’ Label",
    "author": "Curtis M. Wong",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 05:10 PM EST",
    "text": "One of the founding members of the Village People thanked President-elect Donald Trump this week for his continued use of the band’s 1978 disco classic “YMCA” at rallies and other events, while dismissing the long-held belief that the song is intended as an ode to LGBTQ+ empowerment. On Monday, singer-songwriter Victor Willis shared a lengthy note on his official Facebook page in which he recalled how he’d initially asked Trump to stop playing “YMCA” after receiving more than 1,000 complaints from fans. The president-elect’s team purportedly obtained a license to use “YMCA” on the campaign trail, however, so Trump continued to play it. (In a statement to Billboard, RNC spokesperson Taylor Rogers noted that the campaign had the appropriate licenses from performing rights organizations BMI and ASCAP to play the music heard at the Oct. 14 town hall in Oaks, Pa.) After observing how much the president-elect “seems to genuinely like” the song and has been “having a lot of fun with it,” Willis said he “simply didn’t have the heart” to legally intervene. That change of heart also came, he noted, after witnessing the “benefits” of the president-elect’s embrace of “YMCA” firsthand. “Y.M.C.A. has benefited greatly from use by the President Elect,” Willis wrote. “For example, Y.M.C.A. was stuck at #2 on the Billboard chart prior to the President Elect’s use. However, the song finally made it to #1 on a Billboard chart after over 45 years (and held on to #1 for two weeks) due to the President Elect’s use.”“The financial benefits have been great as well as Y.M.C.A. is estimated to gross several million dollars since the President Elect’s continued use of the song,” he continued. “Therefore, I’m glad I allowed the President Elect’s continued use of Y.M.C.A. And I thank him for choosing to use my song.” Willis’ conciliatory remarks come in stark contrast to dozens of other artists ― including Beyoncé, Céline Dion and Jack White ― who have pushed back against Trump’s use of their music.In June 2020, Willis himself issued a statement asking Trump to stop playing “YMCA” and a second Village People song, “Macho Man,” following the administration’s response to the then-ongoing Black Lives Matter protests. Elsewhere in his Monday note, Willis also rejected the “completely misguided” view of “YMCA” as a “gay anthem,” attributing it to the fact that several Village People members ― as well as the song’s co-writer and producer, Jacques Morali ― were gay. (LGBTQ+ listeners have long speculated the song’s lyrics describe ’70s gay hookup culture.)The lyrics of “YMCA” allude to “the things I knew about the Y in the urban areas of San Francisco such as swimming, basketball, track, and cheap food and cheap rooms,” Willis wrote. In spite of the song’s cross-generational appeal, “you’d be hard-pressed to find Y.M.C.A. on the play list at any gay club, parade or other gay activity,” he added. “The true anthem is Y.M.C.A.’s appeal to people of all strips including President Elect Trump,” he said. “But the song is not really a gay anthem other than certain people falsely suggesting that it is. And this must stop because it is damaging to the song.”",

    "text": "Marlena Velez, a TikTok influencer who made headlines last month after flaunting merchandise that she had allegedly stolen from a Target location, has been arrested again for another alleged theft at the same store.Velez, 22, was taken into custody Saturday — her second arrest in less than two weeks — after making off with $225 worth of merchandise from the Target store in Cape Coral, Florida, police there said Monday.This followed her Nov. 21 arrest for stealing $500 worth of merchandise by scanning a false barcode at a self-checkout counter, which made her items appear cheaper, police said.Velez, who boasts around 420,000 followers on TikTok, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Tuesday.Her arrests followed police initially reaching out to the public for help identifying a shoplifter with an image from surveillance footage that they said was taken during Velez’s first shoplifting spree, which was said to have occurred Oct. 30.She was quickly identified by someone who also flagged her presence on social media, with a TikTok page showcasing Velez’s own footage of her going to the store on the day of the October theft, police said.The video allegedly showed her selecting various items in the store that were not ultimately paid for. Police noted that she was wearing the same beige outfit and glasses that were seen in the store’s surveillance footage.“Everything was documented, even the outfit that she wore,” Mercedes Phillips, a spokesperson for the department, said in a social media video that featured some alleged clips from Velez’s TikTok page, which has since been made private.It wasn’t until weeks after the first alleged theft that the incident was reported to police by the store’s loss prevention officers. By the time Velez was taken into custody on Nov. 21, she had already carried out the second theft on Nov. 20, according to police.A police spokesperson declined to say in an email to HuffPost whether Velez is being investigated for any additional thefts at the store or elsewhere.Velez faces a total of two counts of petty theft for the two incidents. Online records show that she was released from a Lee County jail Sunday after posting $500 bond.",

    "title": "PSA: Today Is ‘Travel Tuesday’ — And It Might Just Help You Score A Cheap Vacation",
    "author": "Caroline Bologna",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 03:00 AM EST",
    "text": "Black Friday. Cyber Monday. Small Business Saturday. There’s no shortage of shopping-oriented days in the aftermath of Thanksgiving. One that fewer people are familiar with is “Travel Tuesday.” But if you love exploring new places and scoring major discounts, you might want to get acquainted. So what exactly is Travel Tuesday? How does it work? And what’s the best way to take advantage of the deals? Below, experts break it down. What is ‘Travel Tuesday’?“Travel Deal Tuesday, also referred to as ‘Travel Tuesday’ is the Tuesday following Black Friday and Cyber Monday,” Hayley Berg, the lead economist at the travel platform Hopper, told HuffPost. “Travel Deal Tuesday is a national shopping event where consumers can expect to see more deals on travel than any other day in the post-Thanksgiving sales period.”Hopper is actually credited with coining the term back in 2017. The company, which collects thorough travel pricing data, analyzed its historical archive and found that the Tuesday after Thanksgiving is consistently the best day for travel deals around this time. “The day has grown in popularity so much that last year, the term ‘Travel Tuesday’ saw a 500% increase in searches during the shopping week from 2021 to 2023, according to a McKinsey report,” said Katy Nastro, a travel expert and spokesperson for the flight alert service Going. “This year, we expect it to get even more traction as more travel providers offer limited-time discounts.”While Cyber Monday and Black Friday bring discounted prices on clothes, electronics, home goods and endless other holiday gift options, Travel Tuesday is your best chance to snag an amazing deal on flights, hotels, rental cars, cruises and more vacation fare.“Last year, Hopper saw more deals on Travel Deal Tuesday than on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined ― including nearly 83% more deals than Cyber Monday and more than double the deals available on Black Friday with 91% more,” Berg explained.Your holiday shopping won’t look the same for every recipient on your list, and Travel Tuesday could be the prime time to shop for loved ones who already seem to have everything.“I’d say Travel Tuesday is part of a shift toward gifting experiences rather than things for the holidays,” said Christie Hudson, a travel expert with Expedia.And for many people, a trip is the gift that keeps on giving. No matter where you go, you can make memories and learn lessons that last a lifetime. “Travel isn’t just about seeing new places ― it’s about becoming more connected and understanding how we see the world,” said Jessica Trammell, vice president of marketing for EF Go Ahead Tours.“Travel Tuesday emerged as our industry’s heartfelt response to the endless cycle of holiday shopping ― a moment to remind people that the most meaningful gifts aren’t wrapped in paper, but experienced through connection, discovery and personal growth. It’s about shifting from purchasing possessions to investing in memories that transform how we see the world.”What’s the best way to take advantage of Travel Tuesday?If you want to take advantage of the great deals on Travel Tuesday, set aside some time to think about your vacation goals for 2025 or even these last few weeks of 2024. “You’ll want to plan ahead and know what you’re looking for before the big day,” Hudson said. “Whether it’s a beach retreat, a city escape, or a mountain adventure, having a clear idea of your travel goals will help you filter through the plethora of deals more efficiently.”She also recommended downloading apps and joining loyalty programs for exclusive discounts and other offers. “Hopper monitors prices in real-time and notifies you as soon as a good deal is detected,” Berg noted. “Set a flight ‘price watch’ in the Hopper app for the trips you’re eyeing.”So if you make a list of destinations you’re dreaming of visiting, you can make sure to receive notifications whenever a low flight price pops up. “If you have a specific airline, hotel brand or car rental company you’re loyal to, you can also visit their website to see if they’re offering special promotions for Travel Deal Tuesday,” Berg added. In addition to sharing good flight opportunities, Hopper has also partnered with a number of hotels and tourism boards offering discounts on accommodations. But of course, there are many other options for savings and perks. “If you’ve been thinking about jumpstarting travel plans for next year, or you’re eager to take a holiday vacation, Travel Tuesday is the last day to book with IHG’s exclusive deals,” noted Michael Menis, senior vice president of global marketing at IHG Hotels & Resorts.The international hotel chain is offering 17% off select stays through April 30 ― 25% off for loyalty program members. Other hospitality groups like Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Virgin, Arlo Hotels and more are also running big sales around Travel Tuesday. And there are discounts through online travel agencies like Expedia and Booking.com.“Before making a decision, take a moment to read reviews from other travelers, Hudson advised. “This can provide valuable insights into the quality of accommodations, airlines, or packages you’re considering. On the Hotels.com and Expedia apps, you can filter for reviews by traveler, such as couples or family-friendly, to find properties that fit your preferences.”Although flights and accommodations are a major part of travel, the discounts offered on Travel Tuesday extend to other areas like guided tours, all-inclusive packages and more. “There will be many great deals offered on Travel Tuesday for our solo portfolio of tours, and they are a great way to meet new people and connect with like-minded travelers,” Trammell noted, highlighting EF Go Ahead Tours’ options for solo travelers. “Whether you’re a solo traveler wanting to meet kindred spirits, a lover of food and wine, or you want to go on safari for the first time, we’ve designed experiences that offer itinerary dates into 2026.”One of the best ways to take advantage of Travel Tuesday is to be open to a variety of different destinations and times of year so that you have ample options from which to choose. Don’t feel pressured to jump on a deal just because it’s in front of you, however. “We want people to definitely check out the promotions offered, but be hyper-aware that a lot of what is out there will have restrictions, and some discounts are just OK,” Nastro said.She recommended triple-checking the terms before hitting the purchase button and paying close attention to refundability blackout dates and additional taxes and fees not included in the discount. “Also, you may not find the exact hotel, cruise, or tour being discounted, as a lot of promotions are on select destinations within their portfolios,” Nastro added. “If you’re flexible, you can likely score a deal, but don’t lose sleep if the perfect trip you had in mind for summer 2025 isn’t on the list.”Remember that there are still 364 other days in the year where you have the chance to score discounts and perks thanks to travel-saving apps like Going, Hopper and more. “And don’t forget, we are entering into one of the cheapest times out of the year to travel,” Nastro said. “January and February already see hefty savings on flights and hotels compared to peak seasons.”",

    "title": "So, About That ‘Drinking From A Straw Will Give You Wrinkles’ Rumor...",
    "author": "Michelle Rostamian",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 03:00 AM EST",
    "text": "Fine lines underneath the eyes and deep-set wrinkles along the forehead are to be expected as part of the skin’s natural aging process. But when it comes to lines around the mouth and lip area, TikTok users are concerned with — wait for it — straws exacerbating the issue.Some point to the rise in popularity of tumbler straw cups (hello, Stanley), but truth be told, straws have been a part of the equation for much longer than that.Below, HuffPost talked with dermatologists to get to the bottom of the age-old question: Do straws cause wrinkles?The skin around your mouth is a little different:While the skin on the eyelids is among the thinnest on the face, the skin around the lips and mouth is a close second. “The perioral skin (the skin around the mouth and lips) is bolstered by underlying muscle, fat and bony compartments in our lower face,” said dermatologist Dr. Sara Hogan. “As we age, the muscle and fat compartments flatten and decrease in volume.”By nature, the skin in this area is in constant motion. As Hogan explained, there’s an ellipse-shaped muscle beneath our upper and lower lips, the orbicularis oris, that’s responsible for dynamic movements like opening and closing the mouth, puckering, sucking and whistling. “Over time, perioral lines in the skin can develop in some individuals, and these lines become deeper and longer depending on the frequency of muscle activation and force of muscle contraction, Hogan explained.Does drinking from a straw cause wrinkles?Potentially. In the dermatology world, there are two types of wrinkles: dynamic and static. “Dynamic wrinkles form when muscles under the skin contract and form temporary lines in the skin as a result of the movement, while static wrinkles exist without muscle contraction,” explained dermatologist Dr. Tyler O. Vukmer. “Dynamic movements that occur repetitively over time can and will form static wrinkles,” Vukmer said. While there aren’t any scientific studies that draw a direct correlation between straws and mouth wrinkles, Vukmer said that theoretically, if you’re drinking out of a straw consistently, all day long, over a span of years, it could contribute to wrinkling in a noticeable and measurable way.The skin’s natural aging process, including the loss of collagen and elastic fibers, also plays a role in wrinkles in this area. “When there is a loss of elasticity, the lines in the skin that form with muscle movement become etched,” Hogan said. This, combined with all of the mouth movements we make daily, aging and sun exposure, can cause some degree of wrinkling in this area.Should you swear off straws forever?If you’re an avid straw user, all hope is not lost, and you don’t necessarily have to swear off straws forever. According to Vukmer, using good sun protection is significantly more effective at preventing wrinkles (as well as discoloration and skin cancer) than avoiding straws for the rest of your life. This is because over time, age-related sun damage results in thinning of the skin, collagen loss, discoloration and uneven skin texture — including on the skin around the mouth. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 to 50 for this area, and be sure to reapply every two hours, especially if you’re in direct sunlight.You can also think about the hydration levels of the skin on your lips, too, as dry skin can make perioral wrinkles more apparent. Emollient lip balms and hydrating lip products infused with nourishing ingredients like peptides, collagen and hyaluronic acid can help keep this area appearing smooth.Finally, neuromodulators like Botox, Dysport, Jeauveau, Xeomin and Daxxify are great longer-term solutions for mouth wrinkles. “These work by decreasing how much the muscle is able to contract, and work very well in reducing dynamic wrinkles,” Vukmer said. These injectables can also be considered preventative, as they limit the formation of static wrinkles. Just be sure to go to a skilled and certified injector, as decreasing the function of the muscle in the orbicularis oris area can cause a droopy lip, slurred speech and asymmetric mouth movement, Vukmer warned.Vukmer noted that another injectable to consider is filler or synthetic hyaluronic acid. Filler does a good job of smoothing out wrinkles because it increases the lip volume, thereby reducing the appearance of wrinkles around the mouth. While filler comes with its own risks (migration, asymmetry and over-injection among them), fillers won’t decrease the natural movement of the muscle the way neuromodulators do.If you’re not into injectables, vitamin A derivatives such as retinols and retinoids can address the collagen loss that contributes to perioral lines, Hogan said. “I recommend slowly incorporating the use of retinols and retinoids in this facial area, and always layering with a moisturizer, as there is [a] risk of irritation, flaking and redness,” she added.Looking for a great over-the-counter retinol? These are the best.HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team.

    "text": "My 12-year-old daughter is like everyone else’s 12-year-old daughter: awash on a hormonal sea, her moods rising and falling like breakers in a storm. My tween has thrown her arms up over songs I’ve played in the car, huffed over homemade dinners that didn’t suit her tastes, and even stomped to her room over embarrassing outfits (not hers — mine). But one thing she isn’t mad about? Being one of only a few kids in the seventh grade without a cellphone.An erstwhile English teacher, I’ve prioritized a low-tech childhood for my kids — their two primary leisure options for the past decade being to go outside or read a physical book. I’m no dummy; I’ve long suspected these options would become less and less cool as the years wore on. Ever since my oldest was born, I’ve braced for the smartphone arguments that were sure to come.Trends show most parents ultimately decide that holding off on a phone isn’t worth the expected conflict. I’ve come to believe parents don’t have to choose between giving their middle schooler an iPhone and maintaining a close relationship. All those arguments I braced for? They haven’t happened.I started talking to my kids about phones back when all four of them still piled into my bed on Saturday mornings. I told them early they’d be among the last of their friends to get a phone, always explaining the values behind that choice. Instead of griping about the negatives of cellphone addiction, I’ve focused on the positives of engaging the world around them. We talk about the importance of paying attention and staying alive in a world that wants to digitize everything, even our feelings. I encourage analog living: The kids are used to making enormous messes with art supplies and sofa pillows, and we play everything from Monopoly Deal to badminton. I’ve never wanted my kids to feel like they were missing out on the digital world. Instead, I’ve wanted them to understand that spending time in the digital world could mean missing out on real life. Since my daughter has always known she would be among the last of her friends to get a cellphone, there was never a shock factor, and she’s had her explanations for friends prepared. Which brings me to another reason I think this is working: my willingness to take the fall. I have no problem being the bad guy; I’ve even given her the language to explain how she’d love to have a phone or iPad, but her mom is so weird about that stuff. At 12, the sneers of other girls seem life-ending. At 40, I can handle their derision.Of course, all of this would translate as hypocrisy if I didn’t have a healthy relationship to my own smartphone. I kicked Instagram a couple of years ago, and my husband and I rarely have our phones out when our kids are around. My daughter has seen me take tech sabbaticals, and I explain to her in real time what makes it hard to be constantly connected. (“See how many texts I’ve gotten just since we’ve been sitting here? And they all want me to do something!”) At the same time, I show her the research. I once paid her $10 to read a study about self-esteem in tweens who use social media. She may think I’m crazy, but she at least knows I have the backing of experts.I remember trying to stay alive in the cutthroat arena of the middle school cafeteria, and I keep that empathy close to the surface. I often assure my daughter that I see how it could be hard for her not to have a phone in certain situations, and these regular acknowledgments help stave off her complaints. We talk a lot about how living a meaningful life may require making different choices than the kids around her, but that hard things are worth it. By waiting a little longer than her friends, she’s been able to watch them disappear into their phones, something that seems less appealing when you can feel its effects as an outsider.I do have to give on other issues. Parents can be fanatical about only a couple of things — clean nutrition, maybe, or excellence in sports. I choose to put my energy toward reducing screen time, and I surrender some of the other stuff. Do I love that she and her friends pass around candy like, well, candy? Do I love that they all “need” a newly trendy water bottle every six months? I do not. But by giving in where I can, I show her that the phone issue is not a lack of trust or a desire to ruin her social standing.My husband and I originally told our kids they could have smartphones when they got to high school. My hope is to preserve a free-range, imaginative childhood — but also to give my kids phones early enough to educate them on safe usage while they’re still living under our roof. Within those goals, though, there’s plenty of wiggle room, and my daughter has made a decent case for a phone in eighth grade. She knows I’m open to changing my mind, and that, whatever we decide, her reasons matter to us. After all, there’s no mom trophy for holding out, and kids tend to revolt when they catch the scent of implacability. I believe a phone-free childhood is a gift my daughter can draw on for the rest of her life, and I’m careful to frame our choice as a gift rather than a punishment. Her understanding is developmentally limited by short-term thinking, but she is at least convinced that I believe what I’m saying. One day — when she’s chained to her screens like the rest of us adults, her phone buzzing nonstop in her pocket — her independent childhood is something no one will be able to take from her.",

    "text": "SunFed Produce, an Arizona-based produce company, is recalling cucumbers throughout the United States and Canada that are thought to be contaminated with Salmonella.According to a SunFed Produce press release, the cucumbers were sold between Oct. 12 and Nov. 26 and shipped to 26 states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. (Although impacted cucumbers could be in additional states, too.)They were also shipped to Alberta, British Columbia, Calgary, Saskatchewan and Ontario in Canada.The cucumbers are described in the SunFed press release as “whole, fresh American cucumbers” that were “packaged in bulk cardboard containers labeled with the “SunFed” label or in a generic white box or black plastic crate with a sticker that provides the implicated grower’s name, “Agrotato, S.A. de C.V.”According to the Centers for Disease Control, 68 people in 19 states have become infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella, and 18 people have been hospitalized.“The true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses,” according to the CDC. It takes weeks to determine if someone is part of an outbreak, plus, many people recover from Salmonella at home without a doctor’s intervention, the organization added.If you have SunFed cucumbers you should throw them away and sanitize any surfaces they came in contact with, per the Food and Drug Administration. If you don’t know where your cucumbers are from, the FDA recommends contacting the store you purchased them from and asking if they are part of the recall.Stores have been instructed to get rid of all impacted cucumbers.Salmonella infections happen most often via contaminated food or water. While some people have no symptoms, many people have stomach cramps, diarrhea and a fever. Additional symptoms include vomiting, nausea and headache.Symptoms tend to start within three days of consuming a contaminated item, according to the Mayo Clinic. The CDC states symptoms can take up to six days to appear, and can last between four and seven days. Most people get better on their own, but some groups of people — like young children, older adults and people with a weakened immune system — are at higher risk of complications. People in these categories should talk to their doctor if they think they’ve been infected by Salmonella as there are complications that can happen. If anyone notices signs of dehydration, has a fever of 102 degrees or higher, blood in their stool, they should also contact their doctor.The CDC estimates there are 1.35 million Salmonella infections in the U.S. each year. If you’ve eaten cucumbers recently and have any of the above symptoms, contact your doctor.",

    "title": "This Unexpected Travel Trend Is Going To Be Wildly Popular In 2025",
    "author": "Sara Iannacone",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 03:00 AM EST",
    "text": "In the wake of many people crowding the world’s most popular destinations, overtourism has progressed from a buzzword to a rallying cry for change in how and where we choose to explore.This shift gave rise to 2024’s “destination dupe” trend — where people traveled to different, less-crowded cities with the same appeal and attractions as busy tourist destinations. That concept is now evolving into 2025’s emerging travel movement: detour destinations. The term was coined in a recent travel trends report from Expedia, where data suggests that 63% of travelers plan to include these lesser-known locales in their itineraries next year.But what exactly are detour destinations, and how can you incorporate them into your next itinerary? Below, travel experts break it down.What is a ‘detour destination’?“Detour destinations are destinations within reach of more expected or traditional locales but off the beaten path enough to provide a completely different experience than their more in-demand neighbors,” explained Kimberly Denison, founder of Denison Travel. Detour destinations don’t necessarily encourage travelers to skip popular tourist attractions. Instead, the trend emphasizes balance — spending less time on your trip in oversaturated cities and more time exploring under-the-radar areas nearby. “Post-pandemic, eco-conscious travelers are prioritizing more meaningful and sustainable travel experiences,” said Jeremy Clubb, founder of specialist expedition cruise providers Rainforest Cruises and Antarctica Cruises. “They’re looking to tread lightly, support local communities and dive deeper into the character of their chosen destinations.But there’s also a growing appetite for variety: People still want the predictability of those tried-and-true “bucket list” icons, but now also the surprises that lie just beyond them. Detour destinations offer the best of both worlds, letting travelers mix well-known landmarks with more personalized, authentic adventures.” Chelsea Glass, founder and CEO of Heart of Travel, shared how her company incorporates detour destinations into their itineraries: “We’ve been strategic in seeking out new places and experiences to incorporate into our tours that give our travelers a more authentic experience while bringing tourism revenue to smaller communities and locally owned businesses.”“Many of the experiences we’ve incorporated into our tours have been born out of personal experiences or connections that different team members have acquired over the span of their lifetimes in Latin America,” she explained. Some of these tours include well-loved destinations like Antigua, Guatemala, and Oaxaca, Mexico, but also detour destinations such as Huehuetenango, Guatemala, and Capulalpam de Méndez, Mexico, where visitors can experience unique cultural traditions and a slower pace of life.“Many beautiful places around the world are eager for more visitors, while popular destinations overwhelmed by millions of tourists are hoping to reduce their numbers,” said Penelope Bielckus, travel blogger and content creator at The Flyaway Girl.For this reason, Bielckus recommended places like Sitges, near Barcelona, Spain; Nagoya, near Kyoto, Japan; and Memmingen, near Munich, Germany. These detour destinations allow travelers to experience quieter escapes while still being close to iconic attractions.What to consider when planning a trip to a detour destination.“Travel to detour destinations is rising due to a desire to escape overcrowded, over-commercialized destinations and seek out places that retain their authenticity, traditions and local charm,” explained Marino Cardelli, founder of travel tour company Experience BellaVita. “Travelers are looking for destinations where they can relax, away from the crowds, and immerse themselves with locals in unique experiences that are increasingly disappearing or threatened by the rise of mass tourism.”In addition to authentic cultural immersion and fewer crowds, these destinations provide opportunities to support local economies directly.“These lesser-known spots allow travelers to connect with local culture in meaningful ways, supporting small-business owners, artisans and entrepreneurs whose work truly reflects the essence of a destination,” Glass explained. “Rather than funneling dollars into large-scale, mass tourism, these destinations empower local communities, creating a more sustainable and enriching travel experience.”Affordability is another major draw. Lisa Chen, CEO and president of ToursByLocals, noted that “detour destinations can often be less expensive than the popular, traditional destinations with inflated prices, meaning that you can experience more for your money.”That said, travel experts agree that some challenges also exist. Limited public transportation, tourist infrastructure and amenities like high-speed Wi-Fi or reliable cell service can make navigating these areas more difficult for unprepared travelers. While social media has spotlighted these hidden gems, travel experts recommend working with travel agents or tour companies with deep regional expertise to identify detour destinations that suit your preferences and help you navigate these potential challenges before arrival.“The right tour operator and consultant is key to bridging the gap between curiosity and accessibility,” said Justin Chapman, an African safari expert at Go2Africa. “They help clients step confidently into uncharted territory.”Natalia Borzym, an independent travel adviser with the luxury planning service Travel With Character, highlighted the role of travel professionals in easing the challenges of exploring new destinations. Detour destinations “can feel intimidating for travelers, but agents and tour companies offer reassurance by providing reliable information, safety tips, and 24/7 support when needed,” she explained.With thoughtful planning and local expertise, detour destinations offer immersive travel experiences, quieter escapes, budget-friendly adventures, and a chance to support sustainable tourism in under-visited communities.“Authentic experiences like these are so important for our souls,” explained Nadine Brady, luxury travel expert and founder of bespoke travel agencies travl.love and Limelight Escapes. “They remind us of our shared humanity, spanning across the globe, and have the power to shift our perspectives. We come home a little changed, a little inspired — humbled by the beauty of the world and the people within it.”“This is such a contrast to the feeling of returning from somewhere where we’ve just been another cog in the machine,” Brady continued. “To me, detour destinations represent the future of travel. They’re not about escapism but transformation — traveling in a way that enriches us, connects us, and inspires us to see the world, and ourselves, differently. These are the places that remind us why we fell in love with travel in the first place.”",

    "title": "TikTok Has Demonized This Type Of Parchment Paper — Here’s What Experts Say Is Safe",
    "author": "Anna Rahmanan",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 03:00 AM EST",
    "text": "Parchment paper, a commonly used tool in baking and cooking, has recently been all the talk on social media, with folks claiming that white and brown parchment paper aren’t equally safe to use in the kitchen.On TikTok especially, users have been chronicling their supermarket journeys, extolling the praises of one type of parchment paper over the other, with some also finding third options. Dig deep enough into the world of social media and you’ll find entire reviews regarding specific brands of each product. Clearly, people have opinions. We asked food safety experts and nutritionists about the topic to find out whether we should always opt for one type of parchment paper over the other. What claims are people making about brown and white parchment paper?Chemically speaking, the two products differ in one main aspect: brown parchment paper is unbleached and therefore chlorine-free, while white parchment paper is bleached. Although nobody really seems to dispute that fact, the main questions involve whether the bleached product is automatically “bad” for your health and whether it affects the way food is baked.On Reddit especially, there are entire threads dedicated to the topic. “The color doesn’t affect the bake,” one user wrote. Someone else on the platform revealed their distaste for any sort of parchment paper “or single use kitchen product,” in a way challenging everyone else’s stance on the brown vs. white parchment paper debate.When and why should we use parchment paper in the first place?“Parchment paper is great for baking cookies, roasting vegetables and any time you need a nonstick surface,” said registered nutritionist and diet consultant Catherine Gervacio. “It prevents food from sticking, makes cleanup easier and can help with even cooking.” Of course, there are other options like aluminum foil (which has also recently come under fire) that work well with grilling, roasting, and other high-heat applications. However, foil isn’t nonstick and might require the use of additional sprays or oils that you may rather avoid.Not using any sort of wrapping in the oven “is also good,” said Gervacio, but the practice may require loads of oil, which, in turn, will lead to longer cleaning times and additional calories.The actual differences between brown and white parchment paperThe main difference between brown and white parchment paper involves the treatment of the product prior to use. According to food scientist Bryan Quoc Le, a food chemist and industry consultant based in Washington state, white parchment paper is treated with chlorinating or oxidizing agents. Brown parchment paper, on the other hand, does not use as many chemical treatments in its manufacturing and is compostable.As noted by Gervacio, chemically speaking, the “white paper has undergone extra steps to remove its natural brown color.”That being said, Le explained that brown parchment paper is, paradoxically, more energy-intensive to manufacture compared with white parchment paper.“It contains a higher percentage of lignin [a natural polymer], which is more difficult to machine than treated white parchment paper,” he said. So, white parchment paper is more chemically treated, but brown parchment paper requires more work to be kept in its natural form.The pros and cons of brown vs. whiteExperts agree that, overall, both types of parchment paper yield similar culinary results in terms of texture and flavor. However, there are certain pros and cons to keep in mind when selecting which product to use — most of them highly dependent on the chemical treatment involved in the manufacturing of the items.“Brown paper is more eco-friendly because it’s unbleached, so there is reduced concern about potential chemical residues from bleaching,” said Gervacio. However, she also noted that the product may not be as widely available as the white option.When discussing the benefits of white parchment paper, Le was quick to note its higher hygiene value. “It allows [cooks] to see any contaminants easier than they would with brown parchment paper,” he said, explaining that cooking on a white surface better enables you to see if there are any odd substances that made their way into the food.Although less eco-friendly, white parchment paper is generally easier to find in the average store, which might make it a better option for some shoppers.So does it even matter which one we use?Although the differences between the two products are widely noted, Gervacio did point out that there haven’t yet been studies conducted proving brown paper’s overall superiority. “Both brown and white parchment paper are safe to use, so there’s no need to stress,” she said. “The brown version is seen as a slightly more eco-conscious choice because it’s unbleached, but it doesn’t offer extra nutritional benefits. It’s more about personal preference and environmental values than a health risk with either option.”Le concurred. “Parchment paper is quite safe to use,” he said, “as long as it does not reach its burning point of 425 degrees Fahrenheit in the oven.”However, if looking for another option entirely, Gervacio suggests investing in silicone baking mats. “They are a reusable option that can reduce waste,” she said. “Do know that parchment paper is compostable, though, while silicone mats are not biodegradable.”",

    "title": "Therapists Reveal The 1 Toxic Thing About The Holidays We Need To Fix",
    "author": "Kate Mooney",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 03:00 AM EST",
    "text": "The holidays can be a joyful time to put work aside and celebrate with loved ones over delicious meals and festive gatherings. But it’s not the most wonderful time of the year for everyone: Nearly 9 in 10 adults reported feeling heightened stress during the season, according to a 2023 poll by the American Psychological Association. According to Dr. Jennifer Reid, a psychiatrist and host of The Reflective Mind podcast, a lot of the stress comes from a perceived pressure to have the perfect holiday. It’s the one toxic part about the holidays that often puts a damper on this time of year.“Women in particular, although certainly not only, have this expectation that they can make the holidays spectacular for everyone,” Reid said. “One of the toxic pieces of this is the idea that if we do everything perfectly, which is unattainable, we can control things that are beyond our control.” If you’ve ever fixated on decorating to the nines, cooking an overly elaborate meal, or buying (and inevitably spending too much on) the perfect gifts, you might know the disappointment when your extra effort doesn’t guarantee your desired outcome. Maybe the family fights at dinner anyway, or a gift doesn’t go over how you’d pictured. Reid suggests challenging the internal pressure for holiday perfection: “Where do these expectations come from and are they still serving me?” If the answer is no, it may be time to switch up our ideas about what the holidays need to be. Here’s how:Don’t be afraid to change up traditions.We could all benefit from questioning our expectations for the most wonderful time of the year. Thea Gallagher, a clinical psychologist at NYU Langone, suggested taking stock of which traditions feel meaningful to you, versus carrying on your family’s customs out of a sense of obligation. “One thing that was interesting about COVID times was that people had to think about different ways to make things special,” Gallagher said. “I think that actually helped us to not be so rigid about what the holidays are or how they have to look.” Setting aside some of your holiday break just for you might help you feel more refreshed. “Maybe you don’t want to spend the entire bulk of time off from work with family and that’s OK,” Gallagher said. If you’re traveling, maybe that means leaving a day or two later so you can also celebrate with your immediate family or close friends, or plan a fun and restful solo day. “Prioritize a few traditions that are meaningful to you and focus on those, versus aiming for a buffet of perfection,” Reid suggested. Going for quality over quantity can help stave off the feeling of overwhelm, and may ultimately lead to a more satisfying holiday. If you don’t have the capacity this year, remind yourself that it’s OK.If you’re feeling exhausted this time of year, there are ways to adjust your holiday load to avoid stress and overwhelm. “First off, decide what you’re willing to do, and what you’re not going to take on,” Gallagher said. Then consider modifications you might make, and communicate your availability to loved ones. For example, if traveling feels too expensive or overwhelming this year, maybe you can suggest another less hectic time to get together with family. If you usually host Thanksgiving dinner, maybe you offer to bring a dish to another’s home. If finances are a strain, consider baking cookies or crafting homemade gifts, or talk to your family about setting price limits or perhaps hosting a White Elephant exchange instead. It may take others time to adjust to the changes you’re proposing. “You have to tolerate the fact that some people might be disappointed,” says Gallagher. Ultimately, setting clear boundaries around your limits is better than overextending yourself, which can lead to feelings of burnout and resentment —and that can spread the opposite of holiday cheer. Don’t forget self-care.If we want the holidays to provide a break from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the year, we should prioritize our health and well-being, said Melanie Greenberg, clinical psychologist and author of “The Stress-Proof Brain.” Taking time for self-care can offset the pressure to have a perfect holiday, and help remind us the break should be a time for rest and relaxation.Greenberg suggested regular meditating, even if it’s only 10 minutes a few days a week. If you’re new to meditation, try an app like Calm or Headspace. Alternately, restorative yoga or a favorite workout, body scans, breathing exercises or connecting with nature ― “even if it’s just going outside and looking at flowers or the sky,” she said ― can all provide a meditative sense of calm and release. While the holiday season can be a joyful time to enjoy food and drinks, Greenberg suggests making a plan to curb overindulgence in alcohol, which can exacerbate stress and exhaustion. “The more specific your plan, the better,” she said, whether it’s setting out to only drink two drinks, have sparkling water in between drinks, or leave an event by a certain time. Saying no to some of the invites can keep you from burning out, especially during a season when office parties, friend festivities and family obligations might pile on.Be mindful of time spent on social media, which can lead us to make unhelpful comparisons. “We compare more when we’re feeling insecure or down, and holidays have a way of triggering that in people,“ Reid explained. “Ask yourself, where do you want to put your attention? How can you curate and limit and replace [your social media feed] with things that are positive for you?”Practicing gratitude can help ground us. Reid suggested you write down three things that went well, and why, at the end of the day. “That can be helpful anytime of year, but especially those days when you’re running around and feeling overwhelmed to be able to look back and say, ‘These three moments were really nice,’” she said.",

    "text": "Jane Fonda and Bill Maher agree that they’re not fans of President-elect Donald Trump — but their shared opinion seems to end there.The “Grace and Frankie” star was a guest on Sunday’s episode of Maher’s “Club Random” podcast, during which he gave his thoughts on why Trump won the 2024 election. “There is two parts of the Trump coalition. ... There’s about a third of this country that’s very hard right. Of course they love Trump. When he left office, he had an approval rating of 34%. So he really only had those people. Why is he now, like, tied?” Maher said. “Because the other part of the coalition are people who, they don’t really like him that much,” Maher continued. “They just think the far left has gone so nutty on so many issues.”“That’s what they’re being told … by people like you,” Fonda interjected.Maher has become increasingly critical of the Democratic Party and liberals in general, with the crux of his criticism seeming squarely aimed at his disdain for “woke” culture.Last year, he raged on X, formerly called Twitter, about how he felt the “Barbie” movie was “preachy” and “man-hating” while also arguing that the “patriarchy” doesn’t really exist anymore. And earlier this year, he argued that Louis C.K. shouldn’t be canceled anymore after admitting to sexual misconduct allegations, despite the comedian having gone on to release four comedy specials — one of which won a Grammy — since the accusations were made in 2017.After Fonda called Maher out, she asked him to define what he means by “far left” and to give an example.In response, Maher brought up the NAACP and cited the organization’s travel advisory against going to Florida last year after it accused the state and its governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, of being “openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.”Although Fonda did not push back at this or some of Maher’s other arguments, it was abundantly clear that she did not agree with his opinions. This came to a head later on in the episode, when Maher rambled about Fonda’s long career of activism and implied that even if she lived in a utopia, “it would be the greatest pain” for her because “you’re there for the cause ... but also the cause is there for you a little.”Visibly confused, Fonda replied, ”You’re so different then me that it’s hard for me sometimes to even understand what you’re talking about.”“Really?” Maher said. “We must have a lot in common.”“I don’t think we do,” Fonda responded. “Just your worldview is so totally different than mine. I just don’t see people the same way. … I think you’re very cynical.”",

    "text": "Michael Bloomberg hopes Senate Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump will “rethink” the selection of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary.Speaking Tuesday at the Bloomberg American Health Summit in Washington D.C., Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, said putting Kennedy in charge of the nation’s public health agencies would be “beyond dangerous” and “medical malpractice on a mass scale.”Kennedy has long spread the debunked idea that vaccines lead to autism in children, though he has said he won’t ban them. In 2019, he visited Samoa and lent credibility to anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists. Samoa had a measles outbreak a few months later that killed 83 people, most of them children.Bloomberg said it is “beyond comprehension” that Kennedy would be nominated with such a history, and said he “doesn’t care about evidence.”Kennedy’s own family has also spoken out against him. Last month, his cousin Caroline Kennedy called his views “dangerous” and said most Americans don’t share them. At the health summit, Bloomberg emphasized how many millions of people, especially children, have been saved by vaccines over the years. “Making it harder to get vaccines would be one of the most catastrophic mistakes in American history, a travesty beyond measure,” Bloomberg said.He said America needs leaders who will help parents protect their children, “not conspiracy theorists who will scare them into decisions that will put their children at risk of disease and even death.”",

    "text": "American ski star Mikaela Shiffrin is assuring supporters she’s “on the mend” after falling Saturday during a World Cup competition in Vermont, where an unknown object punctured her abdomen and sent the 29-year-old athlete to a local hospital, per NBC News.Shiffrin was on the final run of a giant slalom event at the Stifel Killington Cup when she fell and crashed through two gates and into the surrounding safety netting. Had she won, it would have marked her 100th World Cup title, according to The New York Times.Shiffrin calmly updated fans Monday on social media with footage of the accident and a lighthearted reference to Disney’s “Frozen.”“Hey everybody, thank you so much for all of your support and love and, yeah — I was impaled,” she said in a video shared on X, formally called Twitter. “Almost just like Olaf … I literally have a puncture wound and some pretty significant muscular trauma around my whole right oblique area.”Shiffrin first updated her fans Saturday in a video from the hospital to confirm there is “not really too much cause for concern” and spoke further about the accident with NBC Sports on Sunday.“I have a stab wound, basically,” Shiffrin said. “We’re just not totally sure how I got punctured, but probably hitting the gate at some point, hitting the base of the gate. I basically have … a hole, like, sort of through my oblique.”The skier, who had the fastest time of anyone during her first run at Saturday’s competition, confirmed in her social media post Monday that she’ll be recovering for “a few weeks minimum” before even considering getting back on the slopes.Shiffrin has won 62 of the 99 World Cup slalom titles she’s competed in and won two gold medals and one silver at two past Winter Olympics, as well as seven golds, four silvers and three bronzes at various world championship events.Although sports are currently out of the question as Shiffrin’s recovery begins, women’s Alpine skiing at the 2026 Winter Games in Italy is fortunately more than a year away, giving her plenty of time to prepare and potentially add another notch to her Olympic belt.",

    "text": "When I lost my husband of 46 years on a cold January morning in 2021, I was devastated. We had agreed that if we did not die together, the survivor should seek happiness, but it was hard for me to do anything but grieve. My life felt like it was over.That summer I broke my leg. Because I couldn’t do much myself, my daughter Vicky, who is also a widow, cared for me. Other than twice daily visits from her to see to my meals and personal needs, I was alone except for my little dogs. The days dragged by, lonely and empty. I read, watched television and tried to retain some sense of self, but I missed my husband so much that I found myself sinking deeper and deeper into a dark pit of depression.Vicky noticed the depth of my melancholy and suggested I try an online dating site. “You could find someone to talk to, and maybe you’d feel better,” she told me.I wasn’t totally against trying it, but it felt disloyal to my husband. Time continued to hang heavy, though, and the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if maybe it would lift my spirits. So I signed up. In my naivete, I posted my actual age of 82, but quickly learned that the cut-off age for a desirable woman seemed to be 80. The men who were not scared away by my real age sent some interesting messages. Some asked whether “all my parts still worked.” Others asked about my finances. Some were interested in sex with someone “that old.” Some men wrote ugly, insulting words that I don’t believe they would ever say to a woman in person. They were sad, pitiful men for whom I have no sympathy. There were also funny comments, like when one guy who, upon learning that I don’t eat mammals, seriously asked me, “What’s a mammal?” The cast finally came off my leg. Buoyed by my freedom, I decided to stop messaging and go on some real dates. I met a man who just stared at me throughout lunch. No matter what I asked or said, my efforts at conversation were met with monosyllabic responses. Finally, he touched my hair and asked if I was really a redhead. I said yes, but of course it had some “help” now. He looked disgusted. Another guy showed up in a dirty t-shirt, muddy athletic shoes and ripped pants and smelled like he was badly in need of a shower. After he learned that I was a veteran, he told me about his own military exploits. He said he thought we had a lot in common, but I couldn’t get past the first impression he’d made. When I signed up on the dating site, I set my age parameters to include men who were at least 62 years old but did not list an upper limit. Late one night, my eyes tired from a long day, I misread a guy’s age on his profile as 65. Though I had grown cynical because of all of the mismatches I’d already suffered, I was intrigued by his attractive photo, so I shot off a short introductory message to him. I told him that I’m not a “little old lady,” I’ve just lived too long to die young. He liked that, and responded with a humorous comment. His name was Ian, and he made me smile — a first in my great adventure of online dating. We texted for a couple of hours that night, and the next day I heard from him again. He was witty without being silly, articulate and interesting. Soon we were messaging several times a day. I looked forward to his cheery “good morning” and sweet “good night, sleep well.” Though I was wary of getting my hopes up — and the potential of being disappointed by another bad date — I agreed to meet him.Before our date, I went back to look at his profile again, and I realized I had misread it. Ian was 55! He was younger than my daughter — by a lot! OK, he’s not a child, I thought, but he’s too young for me. Then I wondered why would a 55-year-old man be interested in an 82-year-old. Was he one of those guys who had a fetish for sex with older women? Did he want something else from me? Was he really interested in getting to know me in a romantic way? I decided to meet him, have a (hopefully) pleasant meal, and that would be that.I arrived at the restaurant first and got a table outside. Ian came through the patio door and walked toward me with a big smile. He looked exactly like his photo. I stood to greet him and instead of the usual handshake I was used to receiving on first dates, he folded me in his arms and held me in a warm embrace.I felt an intense happiness as Ian held me — damn, it felt so good! — and I was immediately at ease with him. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of movies, and I’m a huge fan of cinema, so we instantly had common ground. Soon we were laughing, quoting lines from films, and deep in a discussion of themes, plots, directors and time frames.Ian was intelligent and humorous. He wasn’t too tall, which I liked, and had broad shoulders, which I loved. And his voice! Ever since I was a child, I have loved the deep baritone epitomized by Texas rodeo announcers. He had that broadcaster voice and I adored it.After dinner, Ian walked me to my car, but it didn’t feel like he was helping an elderly person — it was as if he was courteously protecting someone who had just recovered from a fractured leg. I caught myself smiling as I drove home and then it hit me again: 55. He was 27 years younger than me. But, I reasoned, shouldn’t a 55-year-old man know his own mind? If he was interested in a relationship with a woman my age, who was I to question his judgment? Still — 27 years!We continued to text every day. He was sweet, interesting, and attentive, and I found myself liking him more and more. Maybe it could work, I told myself. After all, Cher is in a relationship with Alexander Edwards, who is 40 years younger than she is. Tina Turner was happy with Erwin Bach, who was 16 years her junior, and Carol Burnett has been married to Brian Miller, 23 years younger than her, since 2001. I also love that Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, is 24 years younger than his wife, first lady Bridgette Macron. I met Ian several more times. Each time my happiness intensified. We laughed at the same things — and we laughed a lot. Whenever I experienced his closeness, it stirred me deeply, and I knew he felt the same way.It didn’t happen overnight, but one morning I found myself humming as I prepared my dogs’ breakfast. Later, on my treadmill, I actually broke into “Save The Last Dance For Me.”I wondered if we looked unusual when we went out. I watched for people’s reactions. He held my hand in public and no one seemed to care but me.Did he make me feel young? No, not really — maybe because in my 60’s I had stopped worrying about age. Getting older is a reality, but it does not define us — or at least, I don’t let it define me.Of course, it can’t last, I told myself. I felt cheerful, but in a state of suspended animation, constantly waiting for disaster. I couldn’t see this ending well. The more I liked Ian, the worse I knew I would feel when our relationship was over. I didn’t think I could handle more hurt. I spent half my time feeling great, and half my time looking for a way to end it.And then it happened. The disagreement played out over text and I’m not even sure what we were arguing about. Ian had had a hard day at work — hours spent in blistering, blinding Texas heat. I had spent the day wrestling with taxes and a sick animal. We were both short with each other, and he came across as sarcastic. I don’t need this, I fumed. It’s never going to last — get out now! I told myself. We both sent what amounted to a final sign-off.I immediately felt incredibly conflicted. In some ways I was relieved, as I no longer had to worry about what some people saw as an inappropriate relationship, but I also missed Ian like crazy. I met the perfect guy and I let the years between us come between us. Late one evening after I’d had some wine, I decided that life is too damn short to waste. “I miss you, sarcastic ass,” I texted to Ian. He responded immediately — and was less mean spirited than I had been: “I miss you too, very much.”I began to cry tears of hurt, loss, and loneliness. I wanted his strong warm arms around me again. If I was using him to avoid being old and alone, so be it. “Come over?” I texted. “What — now?” he replied.“Yes.”Our relationship has grown since then. We don’t agree on everything, but that makes things interesting. He asked for Vicky’s phone number “in case anything happens while we’re together.” He didn’t have to explain that my age might be cause for concern.Vicky has been slow to come around, but I know that her reluctance is based on her concern for me. Still, she likes Ian and she sees that he makes me happy, so I try not to worry too much. She and the grandchildren are all the family I have, so her comfort with my relationship is important to me. Time will tell. Ian and I are good together. Not necessarily in a happily-ever-after way, but we’re comfortable and contented, where each day brings laughter and love. Are we in love? Of course. There are many different kinds of love.One day not long after meeting, I asked him what he looks for in a relationship. His list was short: honesty, mutual respect and intelligence. “You checked all the boxes before we even met,” he said. “I was glad to see you were hot, too!” I asked him if he felt I was using him to get over the loss of my husband.“Bill Withers said it best: ‘If it feels this good being used, you can use me up,’” he replied. And I’m happy to report that yes, all my parts work. Is he sexually attracted to me? When a man comes through your door and starts to take your clothes off all in one motion, the answer is obvious.I still go through periods of depression because I miss my husband. He was my best friend and a fellow traveler through so much of my life, and sometimes I still feel as though my heart might actually break. I continue to wear my wedding band — it’s a part of me. We were soldiers together, saw the world together, shared our deepest secrets and loved each other unconditionally, warts and all. My relationship with Ian brings a different kind of happiness — a sunny epilogue at the end of the story of my life. I truly believe my partner of so many years would smile seeing the joy that I’m experiencing.I’ve been with Ian for a year-and-a half. The end of this story has yet to be written, but it is a good story — and a true one. One day it will end, as all things must. But for now, I’m glad I made the decision to accept what life has offered me. With the passing of my husband, life gave me lemons. And now, with Ian, I’m making strawberry margaritas.Note: Some names and identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in this essay.Sue Hunter is a retired soldier, college instructor and sixth generation Texan, who lives amid the cactus, bluebonnets and beauty of Texas with an ever-changing population of independent and highly intelligent animals, both wild and domestic.

    "title": "Hunter Biden’s Pardon Ruins A Key Democratic Talking Point About The Justice System",
    "author": "Arthur Delaney",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 10:23 AM EST",
    "text": "President Joe Biden’s decision to pardon his son has undermined an argument Democrats often made over the past two years. In response to Republican claims the government had been “weaponized” against them, such as by the Justice Department prosecuting Donald Trump, Democrats would point out that the government was also prosecuting Hunter Biden ― without any interference or criticism from the president. “Joe Biden never publicly questioned or challenged this prosecution,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said at a House Oversight Committee hearing last year, noting that Trump criticized the Justice Department for prosecuting his allies and then gave them pardons before he left office. “President Biden’s traditional and scrupulous respect for the independence of the Justice Department stands in sharp contrast to Trump’s spectacular disrespect for the rule of law,” Raskin said. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing in June, Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) noted that both Trump and Hunter Biden had recently stood trial and that Trump insisted his trial was rigged while President Biden said he would accept the outcome of his son’s case. Biden also said, repeatedly, that he wouldn’t pardon his son. “How President Biden and Democrats reacted to a guilty verdict in a case against the president’s son was remarkably different from what we saw in terms of the reaction by former president Trump, his family, his allies and acolytes,” Escobar said. “Democrats are not attacking the institutions that are important to our democracy, but unfortunately, Republicans are. And it’s devastating to the future of our democracy.”At another judiciary hearing that month with U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) approvingly noted the ongoing prosecution of Hunter Biden. “One of the things that makes America great is we are ruled by the law, not by a cult of personality,” Lieu said. “And I want to thank you, Attorney General Garland, and the Department of Justice, for applying the law without fear or favoritism. And I note as we sit here today, the Department of Justice is prosecuting Hunter Biden in a federal court right now.”In announcing the sweeping pardon of Hunter Biden on Sunday, the president for the first time criticized the criminal cases against his son, essentially decrying the prosecutions as a witch hunt. “From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department’s decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,” Biden said Sunday. The younger Biden faced prison time for having illegally owned a gun while he was addicted to drugs in 2018 and for failing to pay his taxes on time. He was awaiting sentencing this month after having pleaded guilty to the tax charges and been found guilty by a jury of the gun charge. Experts have called the charges unusual because the gun wasn’t used in a crime and because Hunter belatedly paid the taxes with the help of a wealthy benefactor.Hunter initially reached a plea deal with prosecutors, but it fell apart last year amid heavy criticism from Republicans in Congress, who were simultaneously running an impeachment inquiry alleging the president participated in his son’s foreign business deals and pulled strings to stop prosecutors from pursuing more serious charges.  “The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,” Joe Biden wrote in his statement about the pardon. “I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice.”Trump frequently whined that his own case was a miscarriage of justice personally directed by Biden. He faced federal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and his hoarding of government documents after leaving office. Of Trump’s charges, Biden and Democrats often said, “No one is above the law.” Since Sunday, Republicans have been gleefully throwing the line back in their faces.  “Do Democrats still think no one is above the law?” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said. House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said the apparent exceptions to the “no one is above the law” mantra include Hunter Biden, “illegal aliens” and looting rioters. Several Democrats also criticized the pardon, saying it will undermine faith in rule of law as well as their own arguments about the importance of democratic traditions and institutions.“He promised he would not do this,” Rep. Jason Crow (D-Col.) told The New York Times. “I think it will make it harder for us going forward when we talk about upholding democracy.”CORRECTION: This article has been amended to correct Darrell Issa’s political party.",

It’s Donald, it’s Elon, and it’s ‘YMCA’ for the millionth time.” The song was a staple at Trump’s events ― with Trump often dancing stiffly to it ― and is now apparently part of the playlist at Mar-a-Lago.“Who do you think’s sicker of that song: The staff at Mar-a-Lago or the Village People themselves?” Kimmel wondered.

Trudeau laughed nervously at the apparent joke, Fox News reported. (Watch the video below.)Trudeau had high-tailed it to Trump’s Florida base after the president-elect threatened to slam America’s northern neighbor with a 25% tariff on its goods, accusing Canada of being lax on immigration and drug enforcement at the border.Fox News’ Peter Doocy reported on the exchange Monday, citing two sources who sat at the same table with the leaders during their meal.“We are told that when Trudeau told President-elect Trump that new tariffs would kill the Canadian economy, Trump joked to him that if Canada can’t survive without ripping off the U.S. to the tune of $100 billion a year, then maybe Canada should become the 51st state and Trudeau could become its governor,” Doocy reported.According to the conservative network, someone at the table noted that a Canadian state in the U.S. would be liberal, prompting Trump to say that the territory could be divided into two states, one liberal and one conservative. That reportedly drew more laughter.If the tariff were imposed, Trudeau might not be the PM to deal with the later effects. He is deemed unlikely to win re-election.Trump’s humor-veiled bombast last weekend was somewhat reminiscent of his declared wish to purchase Greenland during his first presidency.",

    "title": "Michigan Republican Says Gay Marriage Should Be ‘Illegal Again’",
    "author": "Nick Visser",
    "date": "Dec 2, 2024, 11:33 PM EST",
    "text": "A Republican state lawmaker in Michigan said gay marriage should be “illegal again,” an inflammatory remark that prompted swift rebuke from Democrats.State Rep. Josh Schriver (R) made the controversial statement on X on Monday, just weeks after the GOP’s strong showing in Michigan during the November election, where they wrested back control of the statehouse.“Make gay marriage illegal again. This is not remotely controversial, nor extreme,” Schriver wrote. “America only ‘accepted’ gay marriage after it was thrusted into her by a perverted Supreme Court ruling.”He pointed to old remarks from then-Sen. Barack Obama, saying the former president was once “more conservative on marriage than many Republicans today.” Obama first endorsed marriage equality in 2012 — the first U.S. president to do so — and later said he believed the Constitution guaranteed the right to marriage for all same-sex couples.The Supreme Court agreed in a 5-4 ruling in 2015, a historic victory for queer Americans.Republicans have embraced culture wars targeting queer Americans in recent years, particularly trans people. The party has pushed through laws blocking young trans kids from gender-affirming health care, barring them from school sports teams and cheered efforts to limit access to public bathrooms.Michigan Democrats quickly excoriated Schriver.“Please explain how dissolving my marriage, or that of the hundreds of thousands of other same-sex couples living in America, provides a benefit to your constituents or anyone else,” Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D), who is married to a woman, wrote on X. “You’re not interested in helping Michiganders. You want only to hurt those you hate. Shame on you.”Fellow state Rep. Jason Morgan (D), who is gay, said his colleague’s remarks were both “controversial and extreme, along with anti-family.”Schriver has courted controversy in the past. In February, he was stripped of his office staff and committee assignments in the Michigan statehouse after sharing conspiracy theories linked to the “great replacement.” The false notion relies on racist tropes and claims white Christians are being intentionally replaced by immigrants.At the time he said he was opposed to racism, but defended his social media posts and said he found it “strange” that there was an “agenda to demoralize and reduce the white portion of our population,” according to The Detroit News.",

    "title": "‘Totally Stunned’: Shock Winner At Season’s First Big Film Awards",
    "author": "",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 09:39 AM EST",
    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — In a surprise that stunned the audience of Hollywood’s first big awards-season bash, “A Different Man,” a dark comedy about doppelgängers, deformity and authenticity in acting, won best feature film at the 34th Gotham Awards on Monday night.Much can be unpredictable at the Gotham Awards, which uses small juries of insiders and film industry veterans to pick nominees and winners. But as the “A Different Man” ensemble, including Sebastian Stan and Adam Pearson, took the stage, writer-director Aaron Schimberg was in obvious disbelief.“I don’t think I’m the only person in this room who’s totally stunned,” said Schimberg. “Considering the other nominees, I thought it would be hubris to prepare a speech.”At a starry Gothams that drew Zendaya, Timothée Chalamet and Angelina Jolie, most were expecting triumph for Sean Baker’s “Anora,” a comedy about a sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch. It came in the lead nominee, the Cannes Palme d’Or winner, and maybe a top best-picture contender at the Oscars, but went home empty-handed. Instead, the night belonged to the A24 release “A Different Man,” which stars Stan as a man with facial deformities who’s healed of them. He’s then upstaged by the character played by Pearson, who has neurofibromatosis, a condition that covers much of his face with benign skin tumors.The Gothams aren’t an Oscar bellwether, though several of its recent top winners – including last year’s winner “Past Lives,” as well as “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and “Nomadland” – have gone on to be nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, with “Everything Everywhere” and “Nomadland” winning.Whether any of the winners Monday night — “Sing Sing” and “Nickel Boys” were also victorious — will use the early wins as a springboard for more trophies remains to be seen. But the Gothams, a black-tie affair held at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, tend give some sense of the flavor of the upcoming gauntlet of award-season ceremonies.How prominent politics, and the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, might be in this year’s Oscar race is one of the biggest questions as the season ramps up. On Monday, Trump’s name was never uttered on stage (though Stan is in the awards mix for playing him in “The Apprentice” ), nor were there any overtly political statements. But several winners seemed to allude to the shifting political climate. “Let’s keep doing the work that really matters and makes a difference,” said Colman Domingo, who won best lead performance. “That’s what we can do right now. That can be the light in the darkness.”Domingo won for his starring role in “Sing Sing,” the indie drama about a real prison program called Rehabilitation Through the Arts, which helps incarcerated people heal through theater productions. Clarence Maclin, one of the formerly incarcerated men who co-star in the film, won best supporting performance. (The Gothams give gender-neutral acting awards that number 10 nominees instead of the typical five.)“If someone was going to tell me ten years ago, I was going to be here, I wouldn’t have believed it,” said Maclin. “Sing Sing,” also from A24, was arguably the emotional winner of the night. The film’s ensembled also accepted a tribute award. In one of the evening’s most powerful speeches Sean Dino Johnson, a founding member of RTA, spoke passionately about the redemptive qualities of the arts. “Standing here tonight we are proof that movies like ‘Sing Sing’ don’t just entertain,” said Johnson. “They change lives.”RaMell Ross’ “Nickel Boys,” the arrestingly photographed Colson Whitehead adaptation, also won two major awards: best director for Ross and breakthrough performer for Brandon Wilson. Ross’ film, about two Black teenagers at an abusive juvenile reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida, is filmed largely from the first-person perspective of its two main characters.For many, the Gothams are a chance to make an impression with a speech that helps solidify their awards chances. To that cause, the Gothams gave out an array of tribute awards. This year’s crop was particularly starry, including Zendaya (for “Challengers” ), Jolie (for “Maria”), Chalamet and James Mangold (for “A Complete Unknown”), Denis Villeneuve (for “Dune: Part Two” ), the cast of “The Piano Lesson,” and Franklin Leonard, founder of the unproduced screenplay platform The Black List.Jolie, who plays the opera singer Maria Callas in “Maria,” also spoke about the importance of the arts. “It’s so important that art be taught in our schools, and so concerning that is being reduced,” Jolie said.Zendaya, honored for her performance in Luca Guadagnino’s “Challengers,” took a moment to thank her date. “My mom’s here tonight,” she said. “Shout out mom.” Chalamet read a short speech about his transformation into Bob Dylan for the upcoming “A Complete Unknown.” “Getting to study and immerse myself in the world of Bob Dylan has been the greatest education a young artist can receive,” Chalamet said. “If you’re already a fan of Bob Dylan, this will make perfect sense to you. If you’re not familiar with his work, perhaps our film can serve as a humble gateway to one of the great poets and chroniclers of our times.”Best documentary went to “No Other Land,” a film made by a Palestinian and Israeli filmmaker collective that documents Israeli occupation of a Palestinian village in West Bank over the course of years. Despite being one of the year’s most acclaimed documentaries, “No Other Land” remains without an American distributor. Payal Kapadia’s “All We Imagine as Light,” a poetic drama about three women in modern Mumbai, took the award for best international film. Though the film was the first Indian movie in competition in more than 30 years at the Cannes Film Festival, India opted not to select it for its Oscar submission.The award for breakthrough director went to Vera Drew for “The People’s Joker,” a superhero parody about gender identity. Drew thanked Warner Bros. “for not suing me” and Nicole Kidman, an attendee, because, Drew said, “‘Batman Forever’ is when I realized I was trans.”",

In his letter to Al-Shaair, Runyan noted that he has had multiple offenses for personal fouls and sportsmanship-related rules violations in recent seasons.Back in the starting lineup after missing two games with a sprained left shoulder, Lawrence scrambled left on a second-and-7 play in the second quarter of Houston’s 23-20 win on Sunday. He initiated a slide before Al-Shaair raised his forearm and unleashed on the defenseless quarterback.In his letter to Al-Shaair, Runyan called the hit “unacceptable and a serious violation of the playing rules.”“Video shows you striking the head/neck area of Jaguars’ quarterback Trevor Lawrence after he clearly goes down in a feet-first slide,” Runyan wrote. “You led with your forearm and helmet and delivered a forceful blow to the head/neck area of your opponent when you had time and space to avoid such contact.”Al-Shaair is appealing the suspension, according to a person with knowledge of the decision.The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the appeal is pending.If the suspension is upheld, Al-Shaair won’t be eligible to return to Houston’s active roster until after the team’s Christmas Day game against the Baltimore Ravens. Al-Shaair has a base salary of $1.5 million this season, meaning it will cost him about $265,000 if the three-game suspension is upheld.Lawrence clenched both fists after the hit — movements consistent with what’s referred to as the “fencing response,” which can be common after a traumatic brain injury. He was on the ground for several minutes as teammates came to his defense and mobbed Al-Shaair in what escalated into a brawl.As Al-Shaair was leaving the field after being ejected, fans started screaming at him. Jaguars veteran guard Brandon Scherff joined in, prompting another altercation with Al-Shaair. Texans teammate Will Anderson grabbed Al-Shaair and was escorting him off the field when a fan threw a water bottle and hit Anderson in the helmet. The fan was later ejected.Runyan also outlined Al-Shaair’s behavior after the hit in announcing the suspension.“After the illegal hit, you proceeded to engage in a brawl, which you escalated when you pulled an opponent down to the ground by his facemask,” he wrote. “After the referee announced that you were disqualified for the hit and your unsportsmanlike acts, you removed your helmet and reengaged with your opponent while walking down and across the field, which started another physical confrontation near the end zone.”This is the third time this season Al-Shaair has been punished by the league. Last week, he was flagged and later fined $11,255 for a late hit out of bounds on Titans running back Tony Pollard.He was fined earlier this year after he punched Bears running back Roschon Johnson on the sideline in Week 2. That occurred during a scuffle that started after his hard shot on quarterback Caleb Williams near the sideline wasn’t flagged.“Your lack of sportsmanship and respect for the game of football and all those who play, coach, and enjoy watching it, is troubling and does not reflect the core values of the NFL,” Runyan told Al-Shaair in the letter. “Your continued disregard for NFL playing rules puts the health and safety of both you and your opponents in jeopardy and will not be tolerated.”Al-Shaair apologized to Lawrence in a long post on X Monday, where he said first said he didn’t see Lawrence sliding until “it was too late” and that it happened “in the blink of an eye” before saying he was sorry for the hit.Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said Sunday it was a play that ”really has no business being in our league,” and said Monday that the team is considering shutting Lawrence down for the season.___AP Pro Football Writer Rob Maaddi contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Residents of Morris County, New Jersey, are a little uneasy these days.Formations of large drones have been spotted flying over the area every night for at least the last two weeks, according to local media reports.Mike Walsh, a resident of New Jersey’s Randolph township, told Pix11 he’s seen hundreds of the drones in recent weeks. He said they’re aloft “for hours” at a time and don’t seem to follow any discernible flight path. “They come towards you. Then they change direction a little. They’re all going different ways,” he told the outlet. “Some are very big, probably the size of a car.”Morris County Sheriff James M. Gannon said Monday the office is actively investigating the drone activity and asked photographers to send in “higher resolution captures of the questionable flights.”Morris County resident Julie Shavalier told NBC News she’s having trouble sleeping because of the drone activity and is “completely unnerved.”“When I would get up and look out my window at 2 a.m., 4 a.m., they were still hovering,” she told the station.“I got up at 5:30 a.m. this morning and they were still there as the sun was starting to rise. They went back in the same direction they came from, and I expect they’ll be back as soon as the sun goes down tonight.”At this time, he said, the public isn’t in any “immediate danger” from the flights. Should one of the drones crash or land, residents have been asked not to approach it but to instead call authorities.The drones are flying in the same general area as Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. Army installation that conducts weapons systems research and development. President-elect Donald Trump also has a golf course in the area.In addition to the Morris County Sheriff, the FBI, the New Jersey State Police and the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness are collecting information on the flights.The FBI acknowledged in a release Tuesday that the agency has received reports of a “cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed wing aircraft” over the past several weeks.",

But it was beautiful.”In the article, Woodley keeps mentions of her ex to a minimum, but said she “had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022,” which she said led to months of depression.“I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety and, like, complete soul detachment,” Woodley said, noting that she stayed in a “toxic situation” because “empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone.”In a 2023 interview, Woodley spoke about the challenges of dating someone “very, very famous” because with it came “scrutiny, opinions, the desire for people to know my life and his life and our life.”Woodley and Rodgers started dating during the pandemic, and she announced their engagement in February 2021.During her relationship with Rodgers, Woodley defended him against a Daily Mail article that misidentified a man in Los Angeles as the Green Bay Packers quarterback and falsely claimed he had violated the NFL’s COVID-19 protocols by breaking quarantine.She said that the man mistaken for Rodgers didn’t have the same, er, body proportions as her beau.“I know Aaron’s body VERY well. First off his feet, ahem and no offense to this rando dude, are a LOT bigger,” Woodley wrote, added a winking emoji.Meanwhile, Rodgers’ most public comment about the relationship came after the breakup, when he thanked Woodley on Instagram for “letting me chase after you the first couple months after we met, and finally letting me catch up to you and be a part of your life.”",

    "text": "Ann Coulter doesn’t think highly of Donald Trump’s controversial nominee to lead the Department of Defense — but it’s not because he’s been accused of rape.The conservative commentator skewered Fox News host Pete Hegseth’s character during Monday’s episode of her podcast, “Unsafe with Ann Coulter,” but appeared to dismiss Hegseth’s rape accuser and instead took issue with his cheating, calling Trump’s Cabinet pick “sleazy” and a “serial adulterer.”Hegseth was investigated for allegedly raping a woman after speaking at an event for Republican women in 2017. Prosecutors declined to press charges, citing a lack of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”The news anchor, who has been married three times and was in the midst of his second divorce at the time of the alleged rape, has repeatedly claimed that the encounter was consensual.Coulter appears to have accepted his explanation and suggested on Monday’s episode that it was possible Hegseth’s accuser had “cried rape.”She did, however, take issue with his adultery.“In all of this talk about about whether whether Pete Hegseth is an abuser of women, it just, no one even mentioned that he is a serial adulterer!” she told listeners. “Are we a society that doesn’t care about adultery anymore?”Noting that not one but two of Hegseth’s divorces reportedly stemmed from infidelity, Coulter said, “The fact that it was three times, and this sleazy, and everyone at Fox News knew about it is one thing. But seriously ... No one is even mentioning the adultery!”Somehow, Coulter then found a way to blame Democrats for Hegseth’s moral failures.“I’m sorry, this is liberals winning,” she told listeners. “This is liberals changing our culture in this subtle and insidious way where the only rules that matter are the feminist rules, not the rules that have protected women for millennia, like don’t cheat on your wife.”While Hegseth was not charged over the 2017 rape allegation, his own mother called him an “abuser of women” in 2018 email that recently came to light.“You are an abuser of women — that is the ugly truth and I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around, and uses women for his own power and ego,” she wrote to her son.Trump’s willingness to overlook the controversy around Hegseth may have a lot to do with his own history. The president-elect has been accused of sexual abuse by dozens of women over his decades in the public eye.",

    "author": "",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 11:11 AM EST",
    "text": "ATLANTA (AP) — The long-running gang and racketeering trial in Atlanta that led rapper Young Thug to plead guilty in October ended on Tuesday with a jury finding the last two defendants not guilty of murder and gang-related charges.Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, was acquitted of all charges and Shannon Stillwell was found guilty only of a gun possession charge. The verdicts came nearly two years after jury selection began and a year after opening statements in a trial plagued with problems.The original, sweeping indictment charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and used song lyrics and social media posts as evidence. Young Thug, a Grammy-winning artist whose real name is Jeffery Williams, was set free on probation after he pleaded guilty in October to gang, drug and gun charges when negotiations with prosecutors broke down.Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in the 2015 killing of Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as “Big Nut,” who prosecutors say was in a rival gang. Stillwell was also charged in the 2022 death of Shymel Drinks, who prosecutors say was killed in retaliation for the killings days earlier of two associates in a gang known as YSL, which they say was co-founded by Young Thug.Thomas was killed in a drive-by shooting outside an Atlanta barbershop. In the other killing, prosecutors alleged Stillwell pulled up next to Drinks and shot three rounds into his car.Stillwell was sentenced to the 10-year maximum for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon previously convicted of a felony involving a gun, with credit for the two years he already served and the balance to be served on probation.While a total of four defendants pleaded guilty before the end of the trial, the verdict for the final two was a major setback for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Critics had criticized her use of the state’s anti-racketeering law, which she also used to bring charges against President-elect Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.“We always respect the verdict of a jury,” said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesman for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.Defense attorneys criticized the state for relying on song lyrics, saying they were among the faulty evidence prosecutors slapped together along with cherry-picked social media posts and unreliable witness testimony to create a misleading narrative about young men who turned to music to escape economic hardship and difficult pasts.Prosecutors say Williams and two others in 2012 founded Young Slime Life, which they said was associated with the national Bloods gang. The 33-year-old artist also has a record label called Young Stoner Life. Kendrick is featured on two of the most popular songs from the label’s compilation album Slime Language 2, “Take It to Trial” and “Slatty,” as well as Young Thug’s “Slime Sh-t,” which prosecutors presented as evidence at trial.Williams entered a risky “blind” plea — meaning he pleaded guilty without an agreement on his sentence — in October. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker let him out of jail on probation with tight restrictions, including a 10-year ban from metro Atlanta except for certain occasions.The trial has been fraught with problems and delays and shook Atlanta’s rap scene. Williams grew up in an Atlanta housing project ridden with violence and became a highly successful artist who added his own melodic twist to the modern Southern trap sound he helped popularize.Along with using lyrics and posts to prove that YSL was a gang, Kendrick’s attorney Doug Weinstein said during closing arguments that prosecutors threw together random alleged crimes “see what sticks” but did not prove they were connected to a criminal enterprise.While defendants did commit crimes in the past, defense attorney Max Schardt said, it was to make money for themselves in communities stripped of economic opportunity — not to advance a gang. And music let some of them move on.“As a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,” Schardt said. “A sad, tacit acceptance that it’s either rap, prison or death.”Schardt sought to cast doubts on gang investigators and YSL associates the state brought in as witnesses. Several alleged YSL members testified they had lied to police to stay out of prison, and Schardt said officers had threatened them with long prison sentences if they didn’t say the right thing. He suggested one of those witnesses could have killed Thomas.Prosecutors said those witnesses were honest with police but lied on the stand, in front of the people they had “snitched” on. And the testimonies are corroborated by other evidence such as songs and social media posts where they said defendants were “bragging about murder.”Prosecutors said Stillwell and Kendrick were in the car used in the drive-by shooting that killed Thomas and that Stillwell’s social media posts indicate he was involved.Defense lawyer Doug Weinstein said there was no evidence that Kendrick ever got in that car, but rather surveillance footage shows he was in his own vehicle around the time of the shooting. Prosecutors said that Kendrick switched cars off camera and that he was the one who told his counterparts where Thomas was, making him liable for his death.Prosecutors and defense attorneys had conflicting interpretations of the distant surveillance footage in Drinks’ murder. Stillwell pulled up next to Drinks’ car and fired three rounds into his car, then sped away, prosecutors said. The defense said Stillwell drove away before Drinks was shot and that there was no gunshot residue in Stillwell’s car.Jury selection for the trial took nearly 10 months, and Stillwell was stabbed last year at the Fulton County jail, which suspended trial proceedings. Kendrick was stabbed Sunday in jail.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville was removed from the case in July after defense attorneys filed a motion to recuse him based on a meeting he had with prosecutors and a state witness without defense attorneys present. When Whitaker took over, she reprimanded the prosecution for being disorganized and not sharing evidence.Brian Steel, Young Thug’s attorney, said he wanted to continue with the trial because he believed they were winning, but the rapper said that sitting in court felt like “hell” and that he wanted to go home to his family.Nine people charged in the indictment, including Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.___Kramon is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

The “Jennifer’s Body” star first announced her pregnancy with Kelly, 34, in an eye-catching Instagram post last month, in which she appeared to pose nude while drenched in a black substance. In another photo from the post, she showed off a positive pregnancy test. “Nothing is ever really lost. Welcome back,” Fox captioned the Nov. 11 post, seemingly referencing the miscarriage that she and Kelly previously suffered. Fox opened up about the miscarriage in November last year on “Good Morning America.” “I had never been through anything like that before in my life,” she said. “I have three kids. So it was very difficult for both of us.”Fox added, “And it sent us on a very wild journey together and separately, and together and apart, and together and apart, and together and apart, trying to navigate, ‘What does this mean? And why did this happen?’”",

    "text": "A federal appeals court has ruled that Idaho can enforce its abortion travel ban, which prohibits minors from traveling out of state for abortions without parental consent. The decision Monday by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 2023 decision that had blocked the law on First Amendment grounds.The law, signed last year by Gov. Brad Little (R), created a new felony called “abortion trafficking,” defined as when an “adult ... with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor, either procures an abortion … or obtains an abortion-inducing drug” for that minor. “Abortion trafficking” also involves “recruiting, harboring, or transporting” a pregnant minor for an abortion, the law states. Violations are punishable by two to five years in prison.The law’s sweeping language criminalizes anyone transporting a pregnant minor without parental consent within Idaho to get any abortion care, even outside a clinic. It could apply to a grandmother driving a pregnant minor to the post office to pick up a package containing abortion medication, for example. The court of appeals largely upheld the law, except for the language that prohibited “recruiting,” a vague term that was not defined within the law. The panel of judges found the recruiting provision is “unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expressive speech.” Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador, a vocal opponent of abortion, called the ruling a “tremendous victory” in a press release.“Idaho’s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother,” Labrador said. “Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.”Idaho’s law is one of two in the country that prohibit minors from traveling out of state for abortion care. It was the first to be implemented after Roe v. Wade fell and is the only law of its kind that carries a felony punishment. “This decision is devastating for young people in Idaho and the trusted adults who support them,” Rebecca Gibron, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai‘i, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, said in a press release. “Instead of protecting our youth, this law puts them in harm’s way,” she continued. “It forces minors in abusive households to disclose pregnancies, often with severe consequences, while also criminalizing those who would offer them help.”Idaho is one of the most extreme anti-abortion states in the country. The state implemented a six-week ban with a private enforcement mechanism as soon as Roe fell, and Little signed a near-total abortion ban just a month later. Idaho went all the way to the Supreme Court to argue that women should not be able to access abortion care during a medical emergency, claiming that Idaho’s abortion ban overrides federal law that requires most hospitals to offer abortion care if necessary to stabilize the health of a pregnant patient.Read the Ninth Circuit Court’s decision below:",

I think they were kissing a little bit lower than that,” the senator told Fox News’ Sean Hannity of the “Morning Joe” personalities. “They’re desperate for relevance,” he added.The irony wasn’t lost on critics, who pointed out that Cruz was once a fierce Trump critic. The senator, who ran against Trump in the 2016 GOP primary, called his opponent a “small and petty man,” a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral” before Trump was elected president.He eventually became an ardent Trump sycophant even though the former president insulted his wife, Heidi Cruz, insinuating she was ugly, and linked his father, Rafael Cruz, to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The “Morning Joe” hosts have faced backlash from progressives and conservatives alike, and tanking viewership numbers, after they met with Trump at his Florida resort after the election.They said they had agreed to “restart communications” with Trump even though they don’t “see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues and we told him so.” They were some of Trump’s most vocal critics on cable news in recent years, and in the lead-up to the election, likened him to a fascist.

    "author": "Dave Jamieson",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 11:58 AM EST",
    "text": "The Labor Department said Tuesday that it would be phasing out a long-running and controversial program that allows certain employers to pay workers with disabilities less than the minimum wage. The new rule eliminating the program follows years of pressure from disability rights groups and is meant to deliver on a campaign pledge from President Joe Biden. But its future is uncertain due to likely legal challenges as well as the incoming Trump administration.Kristin Garcia, deputy administrator of the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division, said the reform is consistent with the principle that workers deserve fair pay for a hard day’s work. “For too long, workers with disabilities have been left out of that promise,” Garcia told reporters Tuesday.The federal government’s endorsement of a sub-minimum wage for workers with disabilities dates to 1938, when Congress created a wage floor under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Eligible employers receive certificates from the Labor Department allowing them to pay well below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.A 2023 study from the Government Accountability Office found that around 120,000 workers were employed under what are known as 14(c) certificates, so named for the section of the law that allows them. Half of those workers were earning less than $3.50 per hour. Many of the workers are employed in community rehabilitation programs and nonprofits, including Goodwill, and the vast majority have an intellectual or developmental disability. It’s common for these workers to earn wages on “piece rate,” so that they’re paid according to how many tasks they complete in a given time rather than a standard hourly rate.While backers of the program argue many employees will lose their jobs without it, critics say it’s an antiquated practice that discriminates against an entire workforce and furthers income inequality. Taryn Williams, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment policy, said Tuesday that the expectations for workers with disabilities have “evolved” over the decades and no longer match the law as it was written during the Great Depression.“Employers today have more resources and training available to recruit, hire, retain and advance workers with disabilities in employment at or above the full minimum wage, and this proposed rule aligns with that reality,” she said.Under the proposed rule, the government would no longer issue new certificates allowing a sub-minimum wage for workers with disabilities. Existing certificates would be phased out three years after the rule goes into effect. Workers employed under current certificates could remain in their jobs, but the employer would have to pay them at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. That would “lead to greater financial stability, increased purchasing power and independence” for those workers,” Garcia said.The rule must undergo a public comment period and wouldn’t be finalized until after Biden has left the White House. The new Trump administration could choose to ditch the rule and keep the current system intact.",

I read, watched television and tried to retain some sense of self, but I missed my husband so much that I found myself sinking deeper and deeper into a dark pit of depression.Vicky noticed the depth of my melancholy and suggested I try an online dating site. “You could find someone to talk to, and maybe you’d feel better,” she told me.I wasn’t totally against trying it, but it felt disloyal to my husband. Time continued to hang heavy, though, and the more I thought about it, the more I wondered if maybe it would lift my spirits. So I signed up. In my naivete, I posted my actual age of 82, but quickly learned that the cut-off age for a desirable woman seemed to be 80. The men who were not scared away by my real age sent some interesting messages. Some asked whether “all my parts still worked.” Others asked about my finances. Some were interested in sex with someone “that old.” Some men wrote ugly, insulting words that I don’t believe they would ever say to a woman in person. They were sad, pitiful men for whom I have no sympathy. There were also funny comments, like when one guy who, upon learning that I don’t eat mammals, seriously asked me, “What’s a mammal?” The cast finally came off my leg. Buoyed by my freedom, I decided to stop messaging and go on some real dates. I met a man who just stared at me throughout lunch. No matter what I asked or said, my efforts at conversation were met with monosyllabic responses. Finally, he touched my hair and asked if I was really a redhead. I said yes, but of course it had some “help” now. He looked disgusted. Another guy showed up in a dirty t-shirt, muddy athletic shoes and ripped pants and smelled like he was badly in need of a shower. After he learned that I was a veteran, he told me about his own military exploits. He said he thought we had a lot in common, but I couldn’t get past the first impression he’d made. When I signed up on the dating site, I set my age parameters to include men who were at least 62 years old but did not list an upper limit. Late one night, my eyes tired from a long day, I misread a guy’s age on his profile as 65. Though I had grown cynical because of all of the mismatches I’d already suffered, I was intrigued by his attractive photo, so I shot off a short introductory message to him. I told him that I’m not a “little old lady,” I’ve just lived too long to die young. He liked that, and responded with a humorous comment. His name was Ian, and he made me smile — a first in my great adventure of online dating. We texted for a couple of hours that night, and the next day I heard from him again. He was witty without being silly, articulate and interesting. Soon we were messaging several times a day. I looked forward to his cheery “good morning” and sweet “good night, sleep well.” Though I was wary of getting my hopes up — and the potential of being disappointed by another bad date — I agreed to meet him.Before our date, I went back to look at his profile again, and I realized I had misread it. Ian was 55! He was younger than my daughter — by a lot! OK, he’s not a child, I thought, but he’s too young for me. Then I wondered why would a 55-year-old man be interested in an 82-year-old. Was he one of those guys who had a fetish for sex with older women? Did he want something else from me? Was he really interested in getting to know me in a romantic way? I decided to meet him, have a (hopefully) pleasant meal, and that would be that.I arrived at the restaurant first and got a table outside. Ian came through the patio door and walked toward me with a big smile. He looked exactly like his photo. I stood to greet him and instead of the usual handshake I was used to receiving on first dates, he folded me in his arms and held me in a warm embrace.I felt an intense happiness as Ian held me — damn, it felt so good! — and I was immediately at ease with him. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of movies, and I’m a huge fan of cinema, so we instantly had common ground. Soon we were laughing, quoting lines from films, and deep in a discussion of themes, plots, directors and time frames.Ian was intelligent and humorous. He wasn’t too tall, which I liked, and had broad shoulders, which I loved. And his voice! Ever since I was a child, I have loved the deep baritone epitomized by Texas rodeo announcers. He had that broadcaster voice and I adored it.After dinner, Ian walked me to my car, but it didn’t feel like he was helping an elderly person — it was as if he was courteously protecting someone who had just recovered from a fractured leg. I caught myself smiling as I drove home and then it hit me again: 55. He was 27 years younger than me. But, I reasoned, shouldn’t a 55-year-old man know his own mind? If he was interested in a relationship with a woman my age, who was I to question his judgment? Still — 27 years!We continued to text every day. He was sweet, interesting, and attentive, and I found myself liking him more and more. Maybe it could work, I told myself. After all, Cher is in a relationship with Alexander Edwards, who is 40 years younger than she is. Tina Turner was happy with Erwin Bach, who was 16 years her junior, and Carol Burnett has been married to Brian Miller, 23 years younger than her, since 2001. I also love that Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, is 24 years younger than his wife, first lady Bridgette Macron. I met Ian several more times. Each time my happiness intensified. We laughed at the same things — and we laughed a lot. Whenever I experienced his closeness, it stirred me deeply, and I knew he felt the same way.It didn’t happen overnight, but one morning I found myself humming as I prepared my dogs’ breakfast. Later, on my treadmill, I actually broke into “Save The Last Dance For Me.”I wondered if we looked unusual when we went out. I watched for people’s reactions. He held my hand in public and no one seemed to care but me.Did he make me feel young? No, not really — maybe because in my 60’s I had stopped worrying about age. Getting older is a reality, but it does not define us — or at least, I don’t let it define me.Of course, it can’t last, I told myself. I felt cheerful, but in a state of suspended animation, constantly waiting for disaster. I couldn’t see this ending well. The more I liked Ian, the worse I knew I would feel when our relationship was over. I didn’t think I could handle more hurt. I spent half my time feeling great, and half my time looking for a way to end it.And then it happened. The disagreement played out over text and I’m not even sure what we were arguing about. Ian had had a hard day at work — hours spent in blistering, blinding Texas heat. I had spent the day wrestling with taxes and a sick animal. We were both short with each other, and he came across as sarcastic. I don’t need this, I fumed. It’s never going to last — get out now! I told myself. We both sent what amounted to a final sign-off.I immediately felt incredibly conflicted. In some ways I was relieved, as I no longer had to worry about what some people saw as an inappropriate relationship, but I also missed Ian like crazy. I met the perfect guy and I let the years between us come between us. Late one evening after I’d had some wine, I decided that life is too damn short to waste. “I miss you, sarcastic ass,” I texted to Ian. He responded immediately — and was less mean spirited than I had been: “I miss you too, very much.”I began to cry tears of hurt, loss, and loneliness. I wanted his strong warm arms around me again. If I was using him to avoid being old and alone, so be it. “Come over?” I texted. “What — now?” he replied.“Yes.”Our relationship has grown since then. We don’t agree on everything, but that makes things interesting. He asked for Vicky’s phone number “in case anything happens while we’re together.” He didn’t have to explain that my age might be cause for concern.Vicky has been slow to come around, but I know that her reluctance is based on her concern for me. Still, she likes Ian and she sees that he makes me happy, so I try not to worry too much. She and the grandchildren are all the family I have, so her comfort with my relationship is important to me. Time will tell. Ian and I are good together. Not necessarily in a happily-ever-after way, but we’re comfortable and contented, where each day brings laughter and love. Are we in love? Of course. There are many different kinds of love.One day not long after meeting, I asked him what he looks for in a relationship. His list was short: honesty, mutual respect and intelligence. “You checked all the boxes before we even met,” he said. “I was glad to see you were hot, too!” I asked him if he felt I was using him to get over the loss of my husband.“Bill Withers said it best: ‘If it feels this good being used, you can use me up,’” he replied. And I’m happy to report that yes, all my parts work. Is he sexually attracted to me? When a man comes through your door and starts to take your clothes off all in one motion, the answer is obvious.I still go through periods of depression because I miss my husband. He was my best friend and a fellow traveler through so much of my life, and sometimes I still feel as though my heart might actually break. I continue to wear my wedding band — it’s a part of me. We were soldiers together, saw the world together, shared our deepest secrets and loved each other unconditionally, warts and all. My relationship with Ian brings a different kind of happiness — a sunny epilogue at the end of the story of my life. I truly believe my partner of so many years would smile seeing the joy that I’m experiencing.I’ve been with Ian for a year-and-a half. The end of this story has yet to be written, but it is a good story — and a true one. One day it will end, as all things must. But for now, I’m glad I made the decision to accept what life has offered me. With the passing of my husband, life gave me lemons. And now, with Ian, I’m making strawberry margaritas.Note: Some names and identifying details have been changed to protect the privacy of individuals mentioned in this essay.Sue Hunter is a retired soldier, college instructor and sixth generation Texan, who lives amid the cactus, bluebonnets and beauty of Texas with an ever-changing population of independent and highly intelligent animals, both wild and domestic.

    "text": "Roger hissed in protest at Lisa, an animal control employee who had begun pulling him from his cage. He made himself heavy with resistance, attempting to retreat back into his metal box. His eyes widened and pupils enlarged as he bit Lisa’s gloved hand. I could see in her eyes she was unfazed. She had met many Rogers.Lisa placed Roger next to me on the cement floor, the kind of floor that’s easy to disinfect during ringworm, calicivirus and other outbreaks. Roger quieted as he began sniffing my hand, curious about this change in his daily routine.Roger was skinny with a medium-length black coat, which was matted and dulled with dirt and lack of attention. On each front paw was an extra toe, making them look like adorable mittens. In his green eyes, I saw a yearning for love and affection. Underneath his roughness was a vibrant young cat who needed a real home, with soft places to sleep, windows for critter watching and above all, somewhere that felt safe.I was scared of Roger. He had been living in shelters for weeks and now was in the “backroom.” That’s where the animals go that are considered not adoptable, either now or ever, for behavioral or health reasons or both. Roger had been biting potential adopters. No one likes that.He had just one more chance — that was, if a foster from a rescue organization was willing to work with him.He burrowed his wet nose into my hand, asking for pets. I touched him cautiously. When I heard the steady motor of his purr, I relaxed a little. Still, it did not take him long to nip me, even while purring. He wanted love, needed it, but also wanted to protect himself. It was overstimulation aggression — a common behavior from cats who have been under a lot of stress. I could relate. I had once been like Roger. When I was in my late teens, I was so unhappy with myself that I avoided eye contact in mirrors and wore my hair draped across my face. I drank too much and spent many days sick with hangovers and lack of sleep. I snarked at cashiers and servers because they seemed like safe people to get angry at. I was a terrible friend and family member because I was so in my head, worrying I wasn’t good enough while acting like an asshole in an attempt to protect myself. I wasn’t contributing positively to society. I was a producer of chaos and hurt.Still, people loved me. My family loved me and so did the people who reached out their hands to help when I was ready. They saw past my ugliness. I brought that past with me when I looked at Roger. I had a deep desire to answer another’s cry for help.It was the end of November and I was busy with Christmas preparations. Just two weeks earlier, my latest foster cat had been adopted. I questioned whether I should be taking another one, and a tough one, so soon and right before the holidays. My mom questioned it too. “Why do you always make things so hard for yourself?” she wanted to know. My friend Suzi said, “Just adopt one already. You deserve love too.” The shelters were overflowing. Unfortunately, the holidays are usually a busy time for shelters, a time when strained employees, like Lisa, also need breaks while the number of available foster homes decreases. People surrender their animals for many reasons, including financial and emotional pressures or health issues. Some can’t find pet sitters for holiday travel. Some animals run out an open door or are abandoned when guardians move. I once fostered kittens who had been found in a purse, inside a dumpster — literally thrown away, as if their lives didn’t matter.“Rescue work isn’t easy, for anyone. Not everything worth doing is easy,” I told my mom. I told Suzi, “Sometimes rescue work is what love looks like.” I didn’t expect them to understand. I had been watching Roger’s status for days to see if someone else would tag him. He was running out of time. There likely would be no one else. His chance was me.On our way out of the shelter, Lisa gave me Roger’s story. He had been rescued from a drug house where he had been living with 20 other cats. First, he was shipped to another shelter where he was neutered and then transferred to her shelter and put on the adoption floor, all within a matter of days. Then to the backroom. It had been six weeks in a cage for him. It was easy to see why he was stressed. Roger was strangely quiet on the way back to my house. Now I understand that silence as relief; he was free. When I was young and surrendered to others for help, it came with a quietness too. I had let go of my fight. Once home, most rescue cats will explore or hide. Not Roger. Love was what he wanted. I gave him regular, healthy meals, which he heartily ate. I cut out his matted hair and brushed the rest. As the days went by, he relaxed, beginning to trust in his safety. His nipping lessened. As it turned out, Roger wasn’t a tough case at all. He was the biggest cuddle bug I had ever fostered, even snuggling with a teddy bear when I wasn’t available. It’s amazing the transformation that can happen when fear dissolves. It’s only then when we can be our best selves, our true selves. In that way, cats are no different than us. I would watch Roger and wonder about his past: What was it like in the drug house? Did he have to compete for food? Was there a child whom he could cuddle with at night? Was he loved? I thought it more likely he was not even noticed. In my condo, Roger was king. He laid on my lap while I worked or else on one of my many cat perches where he could watch turkeys and bunnies. He had a catnip banana, glitter balls, feather toys and many other toys he could play with. Or we would play together on my breaks. I tried to make him happy and, in return, he made me happy.Right before Christmas, I decided he was ready for his forever home. I didn’t want to keep him longer than was good for either of us. I also wanted to make room for another cat in need.I posted his profile on our rescue’s website. His pictures showed a fluffy Roger with a shiny, healthy coat. I called him ”handsome” and ”friendly” and described him as a lap cat who loves to zip around my home and pounce on toy mice. He had not completely stopped using nips to communicate, but I knew an experienced cat guardian could learn to read his body language and know when he was overstimulated. I explained this in his profile. I wanted to make sure his forever home would accept him as he really was. I knew he would still be perfect for the right adopter. I received several applications. My favorite was from a professional artist and her husband, whom I interviewed on video chat. They showed me their kitty palace — a spacious home full of critter-watching windows. They were experienced with cats and had a soft spot for black ones, who are often the last adopted. Their previous cat had died and she was looking for another muse. On Christmas Day, the couple picked up Roger. He was going home.The rest of Christmas was hectic for me, but my home still felt quiet without him. My family came over for brunch and gifts. We watched “Elf” that evening and Roger was not there to cuddle with. I missed him. But I also felt content that I had been part of something important. It was the best gift I had given that year. It’s been four years and I still get updates about Roger. Roger is king of his palace and now he has a queen friend, Eleanor. They zoom around from floor to floor, watch birds, and play in cardboard boxes. In the daytime, he visits his mom in her studio, and at night, sleeps with his big mitts wrapped around her. I keep Roger’s story close to me. It reminds me that what animals — and people — look like on the outside often does not match what’s going on inside. Roger appeared to be mean. But his prickliness was from being scared. That sounds like many people I have met, including me at times. Everyone deserves love. Everyone deserves second chances. When we give those things, sometimes we get to witness their transformative power. And sometimes, that looks like an adorable kitty who spends his days lying in a sunbeam in his mom’s art studio, playing hide and pounce with his sister, and having a warm, safe place to sleep each night.

    "title": "I Had To Choose Whether To End My Dad's Life. Here's How I Made That Unthinkable Decision.",
    "author": "Sally Schwartz",
    "date": "Nov 30, 2024, 09:00 AM EST",
    "text": "Part of my father fits in the palm of my hand. After he was cremated, and before most of him went into an urn and then into the earth, my sister and I each took a scoop of his ashes.For the past year, he’s traveled around with me. I’ve got a bit of him in my car and a bit in an empty pill bottle that stays in my sundries bag, next to the toothpaste and floss, ready to accompany me wherever I go.My brother shakes his head and tells me I’m nuts, but I know the truth: My father gave his sanction, and his blessing, for these traveling ashes. I know because I have a folder 3 inches thick, with notes taken over the course of 20 years, outlining all of Dad’s end-of-life wishes.Everyone should have a folder of wishes. It took me by surprise when Dad asked me to serve as his medical power of attorney. He and Mom were happily married, so it could have been her. My brother Steven is the oldest, so it could have been him. But I also knew what everyone knew: My father and I operated on the same wavelength. We could finish each other’s sentences. A glance and a smirk were usually enough to understand one another. In asking me to make any future medical decisions, Dad knew I would know, should the time ever come, exactly what he wanted.What I wanted was never to experience a situation requiring me to make those kind of decisions.“You need to die in your sleep,” I said. “A long, long, long time in the future. Or never — I’d be OK with never.” Dad’s hazel eyes, the same color as mine, looked straight at me from across the kitchen table, and we did what we always did: We communicated without speaking. I understood my father had no intention of dying, then or ever. As a pragmatist, however, he needed the document signed.“If I sign,” I told him, “then we’re not done here. I’m going to need to talk to you about all of this.” My mind worked the way my father’s did. In uncomfortable situations, we went analytical. If I signed his medical power of attorney, then I wanted as much data as I could mine to anticipate every scenario. How long was he willing to be kept alive in a coma? How many doctors needed to be consulted before decisions were made? How did he feel about life with physical limitations? Was blinking a form of communication he was willing to live with? We discussed awful imaginary futures. I took notes and then kept the notes in a folder, tucked neatly in a drawer where I hoped it would rot.The folder grew fat. Every year, we sat down to update his wishes. Throughout his 80s, his fear of physical impairment lessened, and the importance of remaining cognizant heightened. How to prolong his life remained the focus.On Father’s Day 2022, I went to my parents’ house early in the day. “You’re the best dad in the world,” I said, giving my still-healthy 91-year-old father a hug. “Also, I need to know what you want for your funeral.”“You’re serious, aren’t you?” he asked. I nodded.Dad assumed his deep-thinking posture: lower lip jutted out, head canted downward, fingertips pressed together.“Open casket. A button-down shirt and V-neck sweater. Three days of shiva. Cremation.”“Can I hold onto some of the ashes?” I asked. Dad smiled. “I would like that.”It was the only exchange about his wishes that ever made me cry.***On a Thursday morning, Dad’s leg gave out. “Goddamn sciatica,” he said. When the ER doctor admitted him overnight because of a slightly elevated white blood cell count, no one worried.On Friday morning, my sister, brother and I got to the hospital at 7. We peeked into Dad’s room, saw he was sleeping, and settled into the waiting room with our coffees.At 8, two nurses approached. “We need whoever has medical power of attorney for your father,” one of them told us.There were the words I never wanted to hear. “That’s me,” I replied.The decisions began. Dad’s oxygen was falling, and he needed to be intubated.Yes.Dad needed a procedure to dislodge a blockage in his lung.Yes.Dad needed a vasopressor — a drug that stabilizes falling blood pressure. Its purpose is to maintain blood supply to vital organs. Yes.Dad needed a second pressor, which decreases blood flow to the extremities. Some people lose fingers or toes, but ...Yes.Time passed. Hopes rose.A doctor approached. We learned fluid was building in Dad’s body. His kidneys had failed and he needed dialysis.Yes.Another doctor told us Dad’s liver had failed, which meant his blood wouldn’t coagulate — one nick from dialysis, and he would bleed out.Not yes. Not no. I needed a few minutes.Three generations of family crowded into the tiny waiting room. We understood Dad’s organs were failing, one by one, like dominoes. It had been 12 hours since the first medical decision.My brother went into business mode. “Let’s go around the room and hear what everyone thinks,” he said, “youngest to oldest.”A nephew began: “Grandpa would want us to do everything.” Eight cousins agreed. My sister agreed.“I don’t think Dad would agree,” I said, touching the folder in my lap. “He wanted to live forever, but he never wanted to linger.” My next words surprised me. “Dad would hate it if we prolonged his death.”My brother agreed. Mom agreed. One by one, everyone agreed. Still, I was the one to tell the doctor to cancel the dialysis — to give permission to extubate my father.I was the one to pull the plug. ***I don’t remember leaving the family conference and giving the doctors permission to stop treatment. What I remember is returning to the little room and curling up on the floor, facing the wall, and crying. I remember thinking about all those conversations with my father and the comfort I’d felt, discussing the mythic future while still secure in a robust present. It’s easy to talk about comas with a person who’s not in one. Rocking on the floor, I realized those conversations with my father had fostered an impossible belief: that we’d have control.In real time, because of those conversations, every member of my family supported the decision I made. Their unified support mattered as the medical staff extubated my father, but it has mattered even more since then. For months following his death, I would wake up at 3 a.m., haunted with guilt. Twenty years of imagined scenarios: How many years in a wheelchair? How many months in a coma? How many professional assessments should be sought? Dad and I never imagined a 12-hour life-to-death scenario. What kind of daughter pulls the plug that fast? That is the imaginary dagger that pulled me from sleep.As I read, and reread, the scribbled notes I took over the years, a few things become clear. The first makes me laugh because it’s so evident and still I missed it: My father never wanted to die. Whatever gruesome tragedy we discussed, all of his wishes amounted to a desire for immortality. Ostensibly he and I were discussing life and death options, but he only ever outlined life and more life.What he meant was life on his terms, and for him, those terms were non-negotiable. He wanted full cognition. He wanted independent agency. He wanted to be relevant. Continuing to breathe without hope of regaining his full faculties did not fall under his definition of life. Ending his medical treatment didn’t just put an end to his suffering — it put an end to what he would have deemed the indignity of prolonging his dying.The last thing I realized is the folder itself doesn’t matter as much as the time my dad and I set aside, year after year, to talk about what no one wants to talk about. At my father’s shiva, when I shared the experience of being Dad’s medical power of attorney and the history of our conversations, there was a moment of mutual shock. Friends couldn’t believe I had a folder, and I couldn’t believe they didn’t. “Everyone dies,” I’d say. “How can you not talk about it?”  When I told my sister I’m haunted by my decision, she doesn’t flinch. “It was the right thing,” she said. My mother, my brother, my children and nieces and nephews all told me the same. They keep saying it, and I need to hear it, even though I know it. I do know it — down to my marrow.What I didn’t know was when you sign on to be someone’s medical power of attorney, it should come with a note of warning: Yes, you might need to make a hard decision, but making peace with yourself following that decision is the true burden.My husband is an ER doctor. He tells me how often he’s seen families fracture when faced with similar decisions. Spouses are frequently too grief stricken to think clearly, siblings don’t agree with one another, and in the throes of panic, DNR orders are reversed regularly. He has seen how chaos and heartbreak make terrible partners. Nothing can ward off heartbreak, but what the folder represented kept us from chaos.***Being able to hold onto some of my father’s ashes — to travel with them — gives me solace. I’m 61, which means it’s probably time to start meeting with my own daughter. I want my folder of wishes to grow fat over the decades. I want to sit across the table and talk about imaginary scenarios over the safety of tea and toast. I want to make sure my daughter understands death is beyond our control, but should the time ever come, I know she will make the right decision, and live at peace with herself for having made it.For over a decade, Sally Schwartz worked as a syndicated columnist for The Chicago Tribune.

    "author": "Jennifer Lunden",
    "date": "Nov 29, 2024, 08:30 AM EST",
    "text": "Skummy earned his punk rock name long before I met him. His friend’s 3-year-old son had discovered him hungover and sacked out in the living room, and announced, “Dad, there’s a scummy man asleep on the couch under a scummy blanket!” Forever after he was known as Skummyman — Skummy for short.I was a few months divorced from my first husband and studying for my master’s in social work when I met Skummy at a punk rock show. My husband had left me for my friend. Twice betrayed, I seethed with an underground fury. Surely it had always been there, quashed by the good girl I’d consistently aimed to be. I paid attention in high school, got good grades, didn’t drink till a year after I was legal (and even then, rarely) and was a virgin until I was 20. Even as a fully fledged adult, I rarely drank, did my best to return library books on time and fully invested in my master’s program.Something needed to break out. And I was gonna let it.I bought a bass guitar and started learning how to play, bleached my dark brown hair platinum blond and joined a punk band with three lovable goofballs. I was 29; they were all much younger, two not even old enough to be in the bars where we played. I didn’t expect to fall for Skummy when I stopped by his place a few years later to borrow his leather punch and add some studs to my bass strap. He was living in a dilapidated storefront, his concrete floor cluttered with cardboard boxes, scrap electronics and a towering pile of salvaged wood. He had a toilet and sink, and a hotplate for warming up cans of beans or soup. No tub. No shower. Remarkably, Skummyman never stank.What I remember is how calm it felt in that space with him. And even though I knew better than to date a drinking man, I wanted to go back, to soak up more of that calm. I took the leather punch home with me so I would have an excuse to return.He was 47 to my 33, a little bit taller than my 5 feet 8, but so skinny it made him look even taller. He had jack-o’-lantern teeth, and he wasn’t ashamed of them. He was Portland, Maine’s punk rock guitar god, and he leaned back when he played, eyes closed, as if he were channeling the notes from some place beyond himself. A southpaw, he played his guitar upside-down, every note articulated despite the speed of his fingers. His riffs didn’t seem to fit the music, and yet they did. He took them all the way out beyond anything sensical, and then, just when it seemed he was never coming back, he’d reel it back in. The punk rock kids stood at the edge of the stage pumping their fists and shouting along to “King of Skum” or “Down Em Up,” or they stomped in circles in the mosh pit, elbowing each other gleefully, reaching down into the mass to pull the fallen back up from the beer-slick floor. They reminded me of a pile of puppies — nihilistic puppies in combat boots and chains.I reveled in this world where anger was exulted instead of verboten. There was a freedom there, and joy. The dark side of life was embraced, as it should be, because when we shun it, we confine ourselves to a thin existence.One night, as Skummy and I were making out on a sidewalk grate at the edge of town, I found myself with a full bladder. I was wearing a silky ocean-blue minidress and — daring for me — no underwear. The area was deserted, and it occurred to me that I could just let go. So I did. At the sound of my urine hitting the dead leaves and detritus below, Skummy looked at me, and I watched his face as it slowly dawned on him what was happening, and we laughed and laughed.Skummy had no formal education beyond high school, but he made his own electric guitars, and a bass for one of his bandmates. He built a bass stand for me, with a graceful, curving spine, naming for me the three kinds of wood he’d made it from. He scribbled notes in a tattered old GE manual, constructing tube amps from scratch. And he could fix just about anything.When I needed a new vehicle, Skummy convinced me to buy a vintage car. I was leery; I needed something reliable. But he told me he could be my repairman. What was sexier than that?We started perusing the classifieds. At the bottom of someone’s driveway, on the way to look at another old classic farther on, we passed a sleek, sexy and magnificently large black ’62 Buick LeSabre with a “For sale” sign on its windshield. We talked to the owner, and Skummy checked under the hood. We took it for a spin, and he pronounced the car sound.The car was a being. I got plates that said GRRR. In that car I felt like the woman I’d never allowed myself to be. That most women don’t. Powerful.Skummyman fixed the LeSabre for me when it needed fixing. He even built me a trash can/tissue box holder out of the scrap wood he hoarded. It fit over the hump between the seats and never tipped. It was a beautiful thing, made with love. I drove that car till the engine blew — that was more than Skummy could fix.***Almost a quarter-century later, in early 2024, I was scrolling Facebook in the cozy little house I share with my second husband when I learned that Skummy was in the hospital. His emphysema was so bad he’d lost consciousness and had been put on a ventilator. He briefly rallied, and his many friends, fans and loved ones all hoped for the best. I wanted to see him. But several years earlier, he’d moved from Portland to western Massachusetts, and his hospital was too far away.When he died two weeks later, the depth of my grief took me by surprise. We’d been together less than a year, more than two decades ago, and although there was no bitterness between us, contact was minimal.A few days after his death, still heavy with sadness, it occurred to me that I needed to gather my memories so I could fill myself up with him. If he were no longer going to be in the world, then I needed him to at least live in me. I pulled out my photo album, the bass stand he made for me and the studded leather guitar strap that had started it all.***I’m fortunate to have a husband who doesn’t begrudge me my past loves. He kindly offered to scan all my Skummy photos for me. One set reminded me of a party I’d hosted at my tiny apartment with the members of my band, some of their friends and Skummy. In one shot, Skummy is straddled on the arms of my Naugahyde chair, one hand gripping a beer, the other having unzipped and pulled his jeans down just far enough to see, scrawled in Magic Marker on his tighty-whities, “PROPERTY OF LUNDEN.” He has a big grin on his face.For most of the year we were together, he lived happily in his place and I in mine, but when his water pipe sprung a leak and his landlord was nowhere to be found, I advised him to call the fire department. That proved to be a mistake. The firefighters deemed it an illegal unit, and he was evicted. He had nowhere to go, and I felt like it was my fault. I told him he could stay with me in my too-small apartment until he found someplace else to live. He enthusiastically set to being a good househusband. That first day I returned from work to a tidied apartment, but, with sadness in his eyes, Skummy led me to the bathroom to show me that he’d broken my glass paperweight, which had split in two when he rinsed it in hot water.  Now it opened like a geode, revealing the rough topography at its core. “It’s all right,” I said, reaching out to touch his arm. And it was. I still keep that split paperweight on my desk. Now and then I open it up to remind myself what’s inside.***It was sweet for a while, living together. Once, we bought a big package of chicken thighs at the downtown discount grocery and baked them all, just to eat the skins. (We saved the meat for a more serious meal some other night.) Another time, when I was feeling down, Skummy told me he knew just the treatment, and he led me to the back of the nearby Korean grocery, where several broken-down boxes leaned against the wall. He pulled one out, reconstructed it and set it upside-down on the pavement. “There,” he said. “Jump on that.” He caught a photo of me mid-air, grinning.After a couple of months of cohabitation, however, it was beginning to feel like my small apartment was getting smaller. I loved him and tried to imagine a life together. He’d need to quit drinking, and I wanted him to get a job, one equal to his talents. But Skummy was feral. I couldn’t change him. And really, I didn’t want to. By his example something in me had been set free. But I couldn’t stay with him either. A few weeks after he moved out, I ended it. ***I wish I could have driven to the hospital to see him one last time. There, in that impeccably sanitized room where he was hooked up to so many beeping machines, I would’ve held his hand and said, “You are my favorite ex-boyfriend.” And he would’ve smiled at the humor of it, looked at me with love in his eyes, maybe given my hand a little squeeze.***Is it possible for a good girl to stand in her power? A good girl is sugar and spice and everything nice. She’s obedient. Polite. And doesn’t take up too much space. So no. I don’t think it is possible for a good girl to stand in her power. Instead, she is constricted. That’s how I felt, anyway, when I think back to my pre-punk times. Skummy once gave me a little button with the image of a bee wearing a crown and, curved around the edges, lettering spelling out “Queen Bee.” At first I didn’t know what to make of it. Was this a diss or a compliment? One look at his warm smile, though, and I knew what he meant. I was a woman coming into my power, and he respected that. To him, that made me hot.I’m not afraid of my power anymore. I don’t squelch it down. I live in it and from it. And I have punk rock and Skummy to thank for that.***The boyfriend after him became my husband, Frank, and we’ve been together for more than two decades. I don’t go out to punk rock shows much anymore — we’re in bed by the time the bands are tuning up. But just the other night The Queers came to town, and I pulled on a black-and-red maxi-dress and met up with Pete, one of my old bandmates. On a chain around my neck hung a small black vial containing some of Skummy’s ashes. Pete and I wove through the crowd to get close to the stage, and as soon as Joe Queer launched into “Tamara Is a Punk,” a mosh pit broke out and the crowd pulled back to open up a circle of space. Someone jumped up onto the stage and leapt into the arms of the crowd, and I was laughing and singing and pumping my fist in the air the way I learned to do — liberated. Again.

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump is considering replacing former Fox News host Pete Hegseth as his pick for defense secretary amid spiraling allegations over his behavior, according to multiple media reports. The Wall Street Journal first reported Tuesday night that Trump was considering pulling Hegseth’s name and replacing him with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a onetime rival and now ardent supporter. Other potential names floated to lead the Department of Defense include Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst (R) and Tennessee’s Sen. Bill Hagerty (R), CNN added.Hegseth, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is the latest nominee to face a fierce confirmation battle amid a series of shocking allegations. A woman accused him of sexual assault during a Republican conference in 2017. He has said the encounter was consensual, but reached a settlement with the woman for an undisclosed sum in 2023. No charges were filed in the matter.The New Yorker published another bombshell this month that included claims he was forced to resign from two veterans groups amid allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety and other misconduct. NBC News added to those allegations on Tuesday, citing current and former Fox News employees who alleged they were alarmed when Hegseth regularly showed up for work at the network smelling like alcohol.“Everyone would be talking about it behind the scenes before he went on the air,” one of the former Fox employees told NBC. Hegseth has denied all allegations, claiming they are political cheap shots made by disgruntled former associates.If Trump does withdraw his support, it would be the second major setback for his soon-to-be Cabinet. Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz (R) dropped out of consideration to be the next attorney general last month amid allegations he attended sex parties with minors.Gaetz has vehemently denied the claims.If DeSantis is anointed to lead the Pentagon, he would be Trump’s latest choice from his home state of Florida. Sen. Marco Rubio (R) was tapped to be his secretary of state and DeSantis is already preparing to name an interim replacement to fill his seat.",

    "author": "Lydia O'Connor",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 09:29 PM EST",
    "text": "Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News personality President-elect Donald Trump tapped for defense secretary in spite of the sexual assault allegations against him, alarmed his colleagues at the network with his alcohol usage, current and former Fox News employees told NBC News on Tuesday.Ten of his colleagues shared their observations about Hegseth with NBC News, two of whom said they smelled alcohol on his breath more than a dozen times before he went on air to co-host “Fox & Friends Weekend.”“Everyone would be talking about it behind the scenes before he went on the air,” one of the former Fox employees told NBC.“He’s such a charming guy, but he just acted like the rules didn’t apply to him,” one of the former employees also said.Hegseth, who left Fox News after Trump nominated him to lead the Defense Department, would also complain about being hungover before going on air, some of the sources said. However, none could recall Hegseth missing work because of his drinking.Even so, one current and two former network employees said they felt they needed to “babysit” Hegseth, with one saying: “We’d have to call him to make sure he didn’t oversleep because we knew he’d be out partying the night before.”Allegations of alcohol abuse and excessive late-night partying are serious considering the job Hegseth is up for. Defense secretaries are called on at all hours of the night to deal with international matters, often with life-or-death consequences. Hegseth’s lawyer deferred comment to the Trump transition team, which said: “These disgusting allegations are completely unfounded and false, and anyone peddling these defamatory lies to score political cheap shots is sickening. As a decorated combat veteran, Pete has never done anything to jeopardize that, and he is treating his nomination as the most important deployment of his life.”Fox News did not immediately return a request for comment.NBC News’ report comes two days after The New Yorker published a bombshell report about Hegseth, a former Army National Guard officer, being forced out of top roles at two veterans groups due to “serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct,” the outlet wrote. The New Yorker article corroborates NBC News’ reporting about his drinking habits, citing an email sent to one of Hegseth’s successors at the organization stating that Hegseth had a “history of alcohol abuse.”The alcohol misuse allegations come as Hegseth is already battling sexual assault allegations. Last month, the City of Monterey, California, confirmed that Hegseth was involved in a police investigation about an assault that allegedly took place at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa during a convention hosted by the California Federation of Republican Women in 2017.Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing and maintained that the sexual encounter was consensual. He has also falsely claimed he was “completely cleared” by a police investigation.The New Yorker report also included allegations that at one of the veterans’ groups, Hegseth and other members of his management team “sexually pursued the organization’s female staffers” and promoted a culture of sexism that led to a male employee attempting to assault a female colleague. And according to an email obtained by The New York Times last week, Hegseth’s mom referred to him as an “abuser of women” in the midst of his 2018 divorce proceedings.",

    "author": "Sebastian Murdock",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 07:23 PM EST",
    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Drug Enforcement Administration has declined the role after Republican lawmakers blasted him for taking COVID measures seriously during the height of the pandemic in 2020.Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister, a Florida Republican, said in a statement Tuesday that he had decided to drop out after the “gravity of this very important responsibility set in.” “To have been nominated to serve as Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is the honor of a lifetime,” Chronister said in a statement. “Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I’ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.”Trump picked Chronister ― who has worked in the sheriff’s office for more than 30 years in the Tampa area ― on Saturday. Chronister has been elected three times to his current position as sheriff for Hillsborough County, The New York Times reported.According to The Times, Chronister has “virtually no experience with the complex international investigations for which the [DEA] is known.” Chronister’s fellow conservatives also pushed back against his nomination over his actions during the coronavirus pandemic.Following Trump’s announcement, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said on Sunday that Chronister should be “disqualified” for ordering the arrest of a megachurch pastor who defied the 2020 COVID lockdowns by holding a church service. Charges against the pastor were later dropped.“I’m going to call ’em like I see ’em,” Massie posted on X. “Trump’s nominee for head of DEA should be disqualified for ordering the arrest [of] a pastor who defied COVID lockdowns.”And Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) told Fox News, “We don’t need authoritarians who refuse to use discretion and protect the Constitution - no matter which party is in power.”Following Chronister’s announcement, Massie posted on X that he was happy with the decision.“Glad to see him withdraw from consideration,” Massie said. “Next time politicians lose their ever-lovin minds, he can redeem himself by following the Constitution.”",

    "author": "S.V. Date",
    "date": "Dec 3, 2024, 06:29 PM EST",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — When Americans elected a coup-attempting, sexually abusing, fraud-committing criminal as president, did they by that choice also lower the bar for those serving in his administration?As they prepare to go before the U.S. Senate for confirmation, Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, Kash Patel, Matt Gaetz — until Gaetz withdrew from consideration — and others have been facing questions over their previous actions and words that have raised doubts about their fitness for the job.Yet in every case, the man who appointed them, President-elect Donald Trump, has done or said things far more egregious during his previous term in office and over his subsequent three-and-a-half-year effort to return to the White House. American voters narrowly returned him to office anyway — meaning senators will now have to decide whether Trump’s appointees should be held to a higher standard than Trump himself.“This question breaks my heart,” said Jennifer Horn, the former chair of New Hampshire’s Republican Party who broke from Trump soon after he was first elected in 2016.Trump campaign and transition officials did not respond to HuffPost’s queries.Critics of Trump’s choice for defense secretary point to allegations of Hegseth’s treatment of women, including an allegation he raped a woman in 2017, in an encounter Hegseth has said was consensual. Yet Trump himself was found by a New York jury to have sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll by digitally penetrating her in a department store – an act that the trial judge pointed out was considered rape in many jurisdictions.Democrats and some Republicans argue that Tulsi Gabbard’s defense of Syrian dictator and alleged war criminal Bashar Assad and Russian dictator Vladimir Putin should disqualify her from serving as Director of National Intelligence. Trump, though, knowingly used Russian help to win the 2016 election, famously said he believed Putin over his own intelligence community, and to this day praises Putin, even calling him a genius for having invaded Ukraine.And while Patel has aggressively spread lies and conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and promised vengeance against Trump’s critics, Trump himself is the prime mover behind the violence of Jan. 6, 2021, without whom the day would have passed without notice. Throughout his 2024 campaign, he has vowed revenge against the justice system that tried to hold him to account.“The fact that Donald Trump has been re-elected is a devastating blow to democracy, and his nominees for the highest positions in government are a reflection of that,” Horn said. “But whether or not these unqualified, Putin advocates are actually seated lies in the hands of the Senate. If they are accepted, it will be a measure of the character and integrity of each Republican senator.”Whether the Senate will hold Trump’s appointees to a higher standard than voters held Trump himself could be in the hands of a small group of Republican senators who have never been great fans of the man who took over their party over the past decade.Erick Erickson, a conservative radio talk show host who supported Trump, despite misgivings, on the belief that American democracy is stronger than Trump, said the Senate needs to evaluate appointees based on what it believes is good for the country.“The president is chosen by an Electoral College selected by the people. His appointees are confirmed by a Senate, some of whom were chosen in 2020, some of whom were chosen in 2022, and some of whom were chosen in 2024, all of whom have their own standards and opinions, which may or may not be the same as the people who support Trump,” he said. “The Constitution still matters and remains a robust check on the powers of all three branches of government.”The prevailing theory on presidential appointments, generally shared by both Democrats and Republicans, is that presidents should be able to have the leadership team of their choosing. That, however, has been tempered by senators’ desire not to give a president a blank check.In 1992, senators forced Democratic president Bill Clinton’s first two choices for attorney general, Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood, to withdraw after revelations that they had hired undocumented immigrants to care for their children.Thirty-two years later, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew as Trump’s attorney general pick after Republican senators said they expected to see a still-secret House Ethics Committee report that reportedly details Gaetz’s payments to a 17-year-old girl for allegedly having sex with him at a drug-fueled party. Gaetz has denied he did anything wrong or illegal.Gaetz, in any event, has not been found liable for sexual abuse by a jury following a trial, as Trump has. Nor was he described by notorious accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein as his “closest friend,” as Trump was.How hard Republican senators, a number of whom were publicly warning against Gaetz’s nomination, will push against some of the others is unclear.At the Capitol Tuesday, Utah’s newly elected John Curtis, like many of his GOP colleagues, largely avoided questions about specific nominees but agreed that Trump’s wishes mattered a great deal. “He gets a lot of deference,” Curtis said.Others, though, made clear they believed Trump deserves complete deference. Idaho’s Michael Crapo said he was fine with whatever Trump wants, even if he submits names that have not undergone an FBI background check, as has traditionally been done prior to receiving a security clearance. “My position is what President Trump decides to do is what I will support,” he told reporters on Monday.George Conway, who supported Trump’s candidacy in 2016 and was briefly considering a job in his first administration but has since become a vocal critic, said he doubts Senate leaders will have much appetite for a fight with Trump.“What they should do and what they will do will be different,” he said. “I think they may try to torpedo a couple of them and call it a day.”To former Republican Rep. Joe Walsh, who also turned against Trump early in his first term, the very idea of rejecting Trump’s nominees for behaviors that Americans have made clear they are OK with in Trump is absurd.“There should be no objections. Pete Hegseth is Donald Trump. Tulsi Gabbard is Donald Trump. Kash Patel is Donald Trump,” Walsh said.“And when it comes to any of these nominees who couldn’t pass an FBI background check,” he added, “we need to remember this: Trump couldn’t pass an FBI background check either.”Trump was convicted in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to a porn star just before the 2016 election. The judge in the case has repeatedly postponed sentencing and now wants to hear arguments from Trump and the New York state prosecutors about whether he should dismiss the case because Trump won the presidential election.Federal felony charges against Trump based on his actions leading up to and during his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt and for refusing to return secret documents he took with him to his South Florida country club have already been dismissed based on Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president.Jennifer Bendery contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Jude Law just made another surprising admission about his hit Christmas film, “The Holiday.” While appearing on an episode of SiriusXM’s “The Jess Cagle Show with Julia Cunningham” that was released Tuesday, the actor revealed the valid reason why he’s never watched the 2006 rom-com with his children despite its massive popularity.Law stars as Cameron Diaz’s love interest in “The Holiday,” which follows two lovesick women who unexpectedly find love while on vacation after swapping homes with each other.The conversation kicked off after host Jess Cagle asked Law if “people just constantly” approach him in public about the film since it’s “become a Christmas classic.” “It really has. ... The idea that people revisit a piece of work is honestly nothing short of a phenomenon to me, and for the first few years, I was always sort of startled,” the British star said.“I just find it so delightful. I’m thrilled,” he added. Law then admitted that he doesn’t “join” his fans in watching the movie annually for the holiday season because “it’s not my family Christmas movie.” “But it should be. Don’t your kids want to see ‘The Holiday’?” Cagle asked.“See Dad and Cameron [Diaz]? I’m not sure,” Law, a father of seven, said with a laugh, prompting Cagle to jokingly respond, “Oh, I forgot about that. Never mind.”According to People magazine, Law is a father to: Rafferty, Iris and Rudy with ex-wife Sadie Frost; Sophia with ex-girlfriend Samantha Burke; Ada with ex-girlfriend Catherine Harding; and two children (whose names have not been shared publicly) with current wife Phillipa Coan.The “Eden” star disclosed another surprising fact regarding “The Holiday” late last month. During an interview with BBC Radio, Law confessed that the Rosehill cottage that’s prominently featured in the film doesn’t actually exist.He also revealed that the cottage interior scenes in the movie weren’t filmed in the charming English countryside and were instead shot in Los Angeles, saying, “Every time I’d go in that door, we’d cut, and we shot the interiors in LA about three months later.”",

Oh my God, did you break in?” Grande asked.Barrymore said everyone on the show was “so excited about you coming here” that they all decided, “‘OK, let’s get the wand.’”“That is the original wand from ‘The Wizard of Oz.’ So there you go,” she explained.Grande still appeared overwhelmed and could only say, “Oh my God.”The segment officially airs Thursday, but you can get a taste of it in the Instagram video below.",

    "text": "Jane Fonda and Bill Maher agree that they’re not fans of President-elect Donald Trump — but their shared opinion seems to end there.The “Grace and Frankie” star was a guest on Sunday’s episode of Maher’s “Club Random” podcast, during which he gave his thoughts on why Trump won the 2024 election. “There is two parts of the Trump coalition. ... There’s about a third of this country that’s very hard right. Of course they love Trump. When he left office, he had an approval rating of 34%. So he really only had those people. Why is he now, like, tied?” Maher said. “Because the other part of the coalition are people who, they don’t really like him that much,” Maher continued. “They just think the far left has gone so nutty on so many issues.”“That’s what they’re being told … by people like you,” Fonda interjected.Maher has become increasingly critical of the Democratic Party and liberals in general, with the crux of his criticism seeming squarely aimed at his disdain for “woke” culture.Last year, he raged on X, formerly called Twitter, about how he felt the “Barbie” movie was “preachy” and “man-hating” while also arguing that the “patriarchy” doesn’t really exist anymore. And earlier this year, he argued that Louis C.K. shouldn’t be canceled anymore after admitting to sexual misconduct allegations, despite the comedian having gone on to release four comedy specials — one of which won a Grammy — since the accusations were made in 2017.After Fonda called Maher out, she asked him to define what he means by “far left” and to give an example.In response, Maher brought up the NAACP and cited the organization’s travel advisory against going to Florida last year after it accused the state and its governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, of being “openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.”Although Fonda did not push back at this or some of Maher’s other arguments, it was abundantly clear that she did not agree with his opinions. This came to a head later on in the episode, when Maher rambled about Fonda’s long career of activism and implied that even if she lived in a utopia, “it would be the greatest pain” for her because “you’re there for the cause ... but also the cause is there for you a little.”Visibly confused, Fonda replied, ”You’re so different then me that it’s hard for me sometimes to even understand what you’re talking about.”“Really?” Maher said. “We must have a lot in common.”“I don’t think we do,” Fonda responded. “Just your worldview is so totally different than mine. I just don’t see people the same way. … I think you’re very cynical.”",

    "title": "3 Things You Should Always Do When Negotiating The Best Price On A New Car, According To An Expert",
    "author": "Am I Doing It Wrong?",
    "date": "Nov 28, 2024, 10:12 AM EST",
    "text": "Unless you’ve got Scrooge McDuck money, buying a new car can be beyond stressful. Aside from the financial strain of such a substantial purchase, there are other aspects of the process that require us to do things that often feel unnatural and can instantly shoot your anxiety through the roof.Take, for example, negotiating the price of the car. If haggling isn’t something you normally take part in, wheeling and dealing to get the best bargain can feel deeply uncomfortable. So how can you drive off the lot in something you love without giving up your life savings — and dignity? That’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, the hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — asked Jessica Caldwell, the executive director of Insights for the car shopping website Edmunds, when she recently dropped by our studio to share her secrets for buying a new ride.Listen to the full episode by pressing play:The three juiciest tips she provided were about how to negotiate swiftly and effectively — and they’re all power plays.First, it’s crucial to let the salesperson pitch a price before we make an offer, Caldwell told us. “Let them give you a price if you’re interested in a vehicle, because whoever goes first is generally in the weakest position,” she said. “I know people who say, ‘I’m willing to pay $35,000 and that’s it!’ … and that might actually be good, and the [salesperson will say,] ‘Yeah, OK!’ and then you just left money on the table.”Resisting the urge to blurt out a number will give you the upper hand as you begin to negotiate the cost. “Say, ‘I’m interested in this car. What’s the best deal you’re gonna give me?’ and then see what they say,” Caldwell said.Tip No. 2 involves harnessing the power of your credit score.“If you have good credit, just be like, ‘Well, run my credit,’” Caldwell said, explaining that if it’s a solid or high score, the salesperson instantly knows the transaction will probably be more straightforward and less challenging. “At that point, they know that you can afford the car and that you’re going to qualify for the top-tier financing, so it’s going to be easier to get you approved.” In other words, a great credit score indicates that you’re an ideal customer — and that they can get this deal done in as little as 30 minutes — so it’s a good idea to flaunt what you’ve got early in the negotiation process.Tip No. 3 is all about confidence. “Walking away is the most powerful tool you have,” Caldwell said. Car dealerships are not like Amazon in terms of the volume of product they’re selling, she reminded us, which means every customer that walks through the door is valuable to them — and they want to do whatever they can to close a deal. “You don’t have to shop in a 10-mile radius. You can shop across the country, you can have a car delivered to you,” she noted. Salespeople know how they treat their customers truly matters, and if the price or the interaction feels off, you should be prepared to leave. Caldwell understands that the thought of using this tactic makes some buyers especially uncomfortable, but she reminded us that this is our hard-earned money and we should spend it wisely — and feel good about the deal we’re getting. “Be emotionally prepared to walk away because many times, they will chase you,” she said. “They will follow up. They will text you or call you with a better deal than when you sat there.” It may not feel great, she acknowledged, but sometimes it’s worth saying no if you know you can do better.We also chatted with Caldwell about what type of research we need to do before we head to the dealership, what to know if you’re going to buy a car online, and much more.

Autumn and winter call to mind warm spices and fresh pines, so if you’re trying to bring those notes indoors, consider grabbing some candles for the holiday season. They’re an inexpensive way to elevate your living space, and especially now with this absolutely wild deal we found: Yankee Candle is currently offering up to 50% off some of its most popular candles on Amazon. That includes the brand’s season-forward Christmas scents in signature hefty, single-wick 22-ounce glass jars.Yankee Candle’s Christmas scents are the hot commodity this month, and a few of its seasonal scents are currently 46% off list price, including Mistletoe (a woodsy mix of berries, pine boughs and holly) and Christmas Cookie (sweet Christmas cookies). Meanwhile, you can grab some of the brand’s mainstays and favorites, like Autumn Wreath (spicy cinnamon apples and fall leaves) or Cranberry Chutney (orange zest, rosemary, raisins, golden honey and cranberries)Reviewers say these candles burn evenly and feel high quality compared to other name brands. “We absolutely love these candles for their wonderful, lasting scent and quality,” says a reviewer named RK. “Yankee Candles are very consistent with their scent and the level of scent in each candle. We have purchased many other brands and have found that do not compare to the quality of Yankee Candles; especially when it comes to filling a room with that wonderful scent.”If you’re looking to set the smelly tone for the holidays, grab one of these candles before this deal goes! And keep reading to see what fans have to say about its bestselling Christmas Cookie candle.Read promising reviews of Yankee Candle’s Christmas Cookie:“This is my favorite ‘flavor’ in candles at Christmas time. I always have at least one on hand for the holidays. I often share them as gifts as well. I will definitely buy more!” — Beth “I like this scent a lot! And the candle has burned evenly and has lasted through burning it sometimes during the day and evening. Good quality, sweet scent and looks nice like yankee candles do!” — Jamie Baker “We absolutely love these candles for their wonderful, lasting scent and quality. Yankee Candles are very consistent with their scent and the level of scent in each candle. We have purchased many other brands and have found that do not compare to the quality of Yankee Candles; especially when it comes to filling a room with that wonderful scent. Speaking of scents, some of our favorites are: Christmas Cookie, Vanilla Cupcake, and Balsam & Cedar. From a cost perspective, these candles are a bit more expensive, but definitely worth it. Just be sure to check the specials on Amazon throughtout the year. They have GREAT DEALS on these candles. Cheers!” — RK “This is our favorite Christmas Candle, its not too overwhelming just gives the best subtle smell. We use it every year, so is has a nostalgic Christmas smell for us!” — Noah “I love Christmas! You know why? Because it’s the time of the year I can stock up on Christmas Cookie scented candles! Woot! Tangent Time! With some trivia thrown in for funsies. Does anyone remember Illumination? Aka the best candle store evah!! Seriously, I saved my hard earned allowance just to buy candles, as I now reflect back that does seem a little tame.. oh well. Anyway, about 25 years ago Illuminations was purchased by the Yankee Candle company. I cried when they closed down all of the Illumination stores. The reason for my sorrow was the loss of a vanilla pound cake scent that was so perfect it felt like you were eating it. If you’d ever smelled it you know what I’m talking about. Why did I just go on that highly entertaining yet random rant? You guessed it. The Yankee Candle Christmas Cookie is the same scent. Actually it’s a touch stronger so I keep it further away but it’s still yummy. If you want a food based Christmas scent that doesn’t include cinnamon and other heavy spices look no further. Buy a few and enjoy! Merry Christmas!” — Mokee",

However, that doesn’t stop some users from resorting to off-brand options — like the HuffPost reader-favorite 3-in-1 charger design — to save a few coins. But today, I’ve found a good deal for Apple purists and non-purists alike: the official Apple MagSafe charger is on sale for only $25 on Amazon. This little gadget has a 1-meter-long charging cord tech and wirelessly charges those pocketable Apple devices just by setting it on its dock. Usually $39, it’s now 23% off the list price. You can skip the hunt for lower-priced chargers and stay within the Apple ecosystem without breaking the bank. Get the deal while it’s hot because it won’t be around long. Several users say the Apple MagSafe charger provides fast wireless charging and its magnetic backing ensures that Apple products snap into alignment when docked. It’s not bulky, either; this is just a 1-meter cord that can plug into your MacBook or a USB-C port and a small charging hub fit for iPhone 12 and later models and any Apple AirPods with charging cases. The MagSafe Charger charges up to 25W when paired with a 30W or 35W power adapter.It’s simply the “best wireless charger bar none,” according to one reviewer, and today it’s at a sweet discount. Nab the Apple MagSafe wireless charger today while it’s at its lowest price of the year!Read more promising reviews of the Apple MagSafe wireless charger:“I went thru 3 different MagSafe chargers and this is the only one that fast charges. This is great. Expensive but really does the job and the cord length is great for when I’m at work. May get another just for home!” — Amazon Customer “Let me start by saying that ever since my iPhone 15 Pro Max updated to iOS 18 none of my cheap wireless chargers are working like they used to. They all say “slow charger”. I’m not sure if Apple changed something or is making it harder for knock offs to work as well as their branded chargers, but I’ve found that the Apple MagSafe chargers are the best and do the best. I wish all chargers were 2m length standard since 1m is never enough. So, I invested in this one and it works great.” — Kyle N. “It is Apple MagSafe, cool, fast charging, no need to bother plugging cable every time you charge your phone” — Yoonjae “I had the 15w magsafe before and it was fast charging my phone, but when I bought my 16 pro Max I decided to change to the newer one, and you can really feel the difference that it goes faster and I like that it is a little smaller and more compact than the previous version, I have the (6.6ft) one and it makes my life easier so I can be lying down charging my phone! 😅 If you have an iPhone you must have this charger!” — Alexander Neptaly Chilel “Slightly smaller than the previous version, this Apple accessory nonetheless does the job well. If you’re using this with other accessories (a small stand, or case, or such) you’ll want to verify that this will fit correctly.” — Ulkesh",

Prices and availability are subject to change.It’s December, and if you’re a fan of the holidays, that means you’ve likely had your festive decor up since Black Friday (or after Halloween if you’re a real holiday head). Let’s add one more festive piece to your collection: a Lego Christmas tree. Why not? Like a puzzle, it’s a fun weekend build you can do solo or with family and friends, and once you’re done, you can display it on a shelf, at your office desk or maybe even under your real Christmas tree. It also beats doomscrolling on social media, and although it’s over 700 pieces, several reviewers say it’s great to build with kids (and get them off their phones!). But if you need one more reason — perhaps the best — it’s on sale today at 30% off its regular price at Amazon. Usually $44.99, you can get one for $30.99 for a limited time.The coolest part about this Christmas Lego build is that you can assemble it as a single tree or two smaller ones. That makes this 784-piece set a two-in-one model. It also makes for a great gift for a loved one or maybe even a white elephant. The model has several ornaments and candlelights on its branches, and according to one reviewer, its topper even spins!Grab this Lego model while it’s on sale today and give yourself a fun holiday activity to do over the weekend or on Christmas Eve. But hurry — we don’t expect this deal to last long!Read on for some promising reviews of this Lego Christmas tree build:“We bought this Christmas tree for our teenager and her teen cousins so they would have something to do during the last hurricane. They loved putting it together, and we loved that they were doing something that wasn’t on a device!” — Colleen “I like Christmas, I’m single so this makes a good sight to see when I’m at my desk or in my living room. Makes me feel festive.” — Nikolas “I gifted this to my granddaughter for her 8th birthday which is just a few days before Christmas. She couldn’t wait to dig into this Lego set, and made 2 trees by herself with no help whatsoever from an adult. She’s good at reading directions, and this set occluded her for hours on a no-school day just before Christmas. I assume they’ll keep the trees with their Christmas decorations; if not, she’ll have fun tearing them apart and making new constructions.” — Jill Clardy “Our kids had fun building this Lego set for Christmas this year. You can build either one large tree or two small ones. Our children built the two smaller ones, one for each kid!” — Justin & Kaitlyn “My grandma bought this for me and I love it! You get a lot of different things you can do with it. Like a big tree or 2 smaller ones. The durability is a bit questionable, the candles fall off when bumped very slightly and it comes apart at the base if not handled correctly. But I love how the top spins! It is easy to put together, you just have to keep the bags separated so you don’t mix the pieces.” — Millie Moran",

    "text": "Eager to shower and get to bed after a late-night arrival in Brussels last summer, my husband and I were disappointed — but not surprised — to find that my wheelchair didn’t fit into the bathroom of our supposedly accessible hotel room. Too late to find a new hotel to stay in after a short but laborious flight from our home in Dublin, I clumsily lowered myself to the floor, scooted into the shower and sat while my husband angled the showerhead toward me and sprayed me down. Using the toilet was an even bigger issue, but I’ll spare you the details.Navigating hotels as a person with a disability can be challenging in unexpected ways. After a long day of traveling, nothing feels better than settling into a cozy bed. But for wheelchair users like me, there are often several obstacles that keep us from resting, relaxing and getting anything else done in a hotel room that was clearly not designed with anyone like me in mind. From stories about beds being too high to limited floor space and roll-in nightmares, there are so many things that the global hospitality industry needs to address.I have to hope that change is underway, because this can’t be as good as it gets. I spoke to several big hotel groups about what they’re doing to ensure better accessibility for their disabled guests — and some of them appeared to already have plans in action.IHG Hotels & Resorts is comprised of 19 brands include EVEN and Crowne Plaza, as well as, on a luxury level, Kimpton and InterContinental Hotels & Resorts; they’re recently launched an inclusivity initiative that prioritizes accessibility through a pledge to focus on diversity in clientele.“By championing accessibility from the outset, we are rethinking how our environments enable every guest to find restoration and rest within our rooms,” Melissa Messmer, the head of global design for InterContinental at IHG Hotels & Resorts, told me. Messmer noted that, historically, accessibility in the hospitality industry has been an afterthought — and I wholeheartedly agreed, as I’ve experienced all the shortcomings for years. I learned that it can be easier for some structures to get accessibly face-lifts than others. The Kimpton Fitzroy in London, which was aquired by IHG in 2018, is old and grand — sort of a historic landmark. Some renovations have been made on the hotel since it opened its doors as The Russell in 1898, but there was a larger focus on wheelchair accessibility starting 2014. For example, the hotel’s entrance was fitted with a wheelchair lift using modern engineering and construction methods.To Bryan Houser, vice president of preconstruction lifecycle at IHG, a strong design aesthetic is always inclusive. He and his team strive toward a balance of thoughtful function and aesthetic strategizing to create comfortable environments for their guests with different disabilities.And to tap into what this requires, InterContinental Hotels & Resorts work with the U.K.-based Motionspot, an inclusive design consultancy creating beautifully designed environments that center people with various disabilities.“Traditionally, accessible design has been functional — the bare minimum of what a person needs to carry out their daily tasks” said Ed Warner, the CEO of Motionspot. “However, this is not enough for a person to express themselves and reach their full potential. Truly inclusive design is about blending function and form to create spaces which enable and inspire.”Partnerships like these are not just cool — they’re necessary, because design decisions about accessibility really can’t be made by a bunch of people who have never used a mobility aid.Marriott International, in hopes of making properties more comfortable for those with mobility issues, is engaging with people with disabilities to inform its decision-making in the development of its Room for All initiative. It’s also working with inclusive design consultant Elise Roy, a deaf, human-centered designer who delivered a thought-provoking TEDx talk back in 2015 called “When We Design for Disability, We All Benefit.”Based in Marriott’s Maryland headquarters, the Room for All project will see the development of new digital features such as voice-activated temperature and lighting control, as well as room layouts that have fewer physical barriers and increase accessibility for guests who use wheelchairs.Similarly, the company Accor has partnered with Jaccede — a collaborative platform where users review the accessibility of places they’ve visited, aiming to help people with reduced mobility identify establishments that can meet their access needs. The transparency of real guests posting about their stays is really appealing here.New in-room features are also key to Accor’s quest to make hotels in its roster (like Sofitel, Novotel and Ibis) more accessible to people with mobility aids. Accor’s recently launched “smart rooms” use technological innovation — including adapted, adjustable bathrooms and connected tablets to control the rooms’ equipment — to create a richer overall hospitality experience.Anne-Sophie Beraud, senior vice president of group diversity inclusion and social care at Accor, stressed to me that the brands are not only focused on improving physical accessibility for their guests, but also on creating a better work environment for hotel staff with disabilities. They offer extensive training to foster healthy attitudes and reactions toward disability, as well as self-assessment programs.The hotels also go through a certification process with the French organization Tourisme & Handicap — part of an action plan among hotel stakeholders in France ahead of the 2024 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in Paris — to advance their commitment to accommodating guests with disabilities. Beraud hopes that these efforts will “not only establish a legacy of inclusivity, but also facilitate the global adoption of these best practices.”After chatting with leaders in these hotel groups, I do feel a little more hopeful about change across the industry. The evolution of attitudes and actions in hotel tourism feels slow but palpable. Many of the hotels that execute new tech and accessibility features might be out of reach for those who aren’t rich. But hopefully, in the no-so-distant future, these features will become a staple of all hotels. Really, it’s beneficial for everyone.“Ensuring there is accessible hotel provision is not only the right thing to do,” said Warner, “it also makes solid business sense.”A 2020 market study by Open Doors Organization revealed that in 2018 and 2019, adults with disabilities in the U.S. spent a staggering $58.7 billion on their travel adventures. A similar study by VisitBritain uncovered that individuals with disabilities contribute a noteworthy 14.6 billion pounds each year to England’s travel economy. We are out on adventures too, and we want to spend our money on accommodations that make us feel seen and safe.Failing to cater to the access needs of people with disabilities closes the door on numerous significant revenue streams. Mobility Mojo, a company that empowers organizations “to create more accessible and inclusive environments,” reported that the accessible tourism market is the fastest-growing but most underserved market in tourism.The best way, in my opinion, that hotels can address inaccessibility is by working with disabled people, designers like Roy and agencies like Motionspot. We are, after all, experts through our own experiences. And since vacations are short, and I deserve as comfortable a stay as anyone else, I’m going to continue to ask the uncomfortable questions — and choose spaces that value my money.",

    "text": "Jacob, a young homeless man with hearing loss, recently walked into one of the free clinics that my colleagues and I  had organized at his shelter. He sat down with me and described how severe hearing loss had impacted his life. During a previous job interview, he had been unable to properly hear the interviewer, forcing him to ask his potential employer to speak louder and repeat himself multiple times.He was not offered the job. Jacob told me that he was feeling depressed, and that he was losing faith in his ability to provide for himself. Unfortunately, his story is not unique. As an ear, nose and throat physician who has practiced in Chicago for the last 20 years, I’ve met countless individuals like Jacob who are housing-insecure and whose health issues prevent them from improving their circumstances.And yet, as you might imagine, I have never had a homeless person call to make an appointment with my office. The stark reality is that health care remains out of reach for most of the homeless population in the U.S. due to societal neglect and systemic barriers pertaining to technology, transportation and cost.To address this disparity, we initially began visiting local shelters with the goal of providing on-site care, but soon realized that this mobile care model limited our impact significantly. Being on-site in the shelters meant that we couldn’t provide certain medical services, and we were ultimately unable to see everyone that needed to be seen.So we realized that we’d have to bring the patients to us.The Center for the Underserved at Rush ENT — or CURE — initiative was founded in 2022 with a mission to improve access to compassionate and high-quality care in the medically underserved community of Chicago’s West Side. Our program provides a direct avenue for care and features a free, weekly ENT clinic where homeless and migrant individuals can come to be diagnosed and treated. We use ride-sharing apps to transport patients to and from the clinic, and we offer a free meal to all, along with the highest quality of care.The clinic, a labor of love and an effort of hope, is staffed entirely by physicians, nurses and medical students who volunteer their time. These colleagues show up in the evening, week after week, to take care of people who would otherwise be deprived of the care they deserve. As a result of their dedication, commitment and perseverance, we are finally beginning to confront this massive blind spot in our health care system.What we’ve found most troubling is the degree to which certain patient demographics are being overlooked. In response to a great need, we began offering care to the migrant community last November, assembling a team of providers to visit the police stations and shelters where migrants were living. From telemedicine visits at shelters to in-person consultations, we have shaped our services to minimize potential barriers to access and provide care to those who need it most.In Chicago alone, more than 12,000 migrants — we see patients from places like Venezuela, Guatemala, Brazil and occasionally India — are currently residing in shelters, facing issues of access and an inability to pay. Regardless of our political beliefs regarding immigration, we have to acknowledge that migrants are here now in our cities, seeking safety. And if we fail to help them access quality care, their health — and that of our communities — will suffer.As physicians, we bear the responsibility to care for a human being regardless of their race, country of origin, or financial status, treating each one with the same dignity, respect and compassion that they are entitled to. And in a health care system experiencing tremendous financial strain, everyone in the medical field needs to focus on developing solutions for homeless and migrant people. From what I’ve learned during this process, the first step is acknowledging every factor that prevents homeless and migrant people from getting health care.Most homeless and migrant individuals don’t have access to a doctor they’ve seen more than once. Most don’t have insurance. If they do, it is usually a government-subsidized plan that only covers a sliver of the costs.Others simply avoid seeking treatment due to their mistrust of medical professionals. Those who do seek out care often go to hospital emergency rooms — where they can receive care regardless of their ability to pay. However, these visits place a huge financial burden on our health care system, and this financial burden will only worsen as the migrant population continues to grow. So ultimately, the void we’re trying to fill by providing people care before it becomes an emergency is not just beneficial to at-risk populations — but to everyone.Rather than investing vast financial resources in emergency care, funds would ideally be directed toward less costly preventive care measures delivered via unique models like CURE’s. Everything we have seen during the past two years has shown us that this model is working.We’ve seen an increasing number of patients come to us for not only acute but also follow-up care, which is monumental. Furthermore, we have broadened our services to include orthopedic foot and ankle care, and we intend to continue expanding, with the long-term goal of offering fully comprehensive specialty services to those in need.Having observed these trends within our own clinic, we believe in earnest that the CURE model can serve as a blueprint for health care systems in other American cities where providers are struggling to care for their most vulnerable.We have had hundreds of patients come through our clinic in a position similar to the one that Jacob was in. In Jacob’s case, my audiology colleagues were able to perform a hearing test and subsequently fit him with new hearing aids. At one of his recent follow-up visits, he joyfully shared with me that he had been offered a job. The hearing aids had made all the difference.Jacob’s story is a powerful reminder of the dignity and opportunities that access to equitable and compassionate care can provide. If we hope to one day offer high-quality care to everyone in Jacob’s position, our health care system will require transformative solutions and a lot of creativity. But it’s possible — and we want everyone to see how fruitful this change can be.",

    "text": "Karissa Valencia, a member of the Samala Chumash tribe, remembers growing up on and off the reservation, spending time with one parent in the Santa Ynez Valley and the other in San Diego. When kids animation was thriving in the ’90s, Valencia distinctly remembers the limited illustrations of Native characters on screen.“As a little kid. I still remember one year at our powwow, Irene Bedard, who voiced Pocahontas, was there. I still remember asking her to sign my DVD. It was like the best day in the world. I was like, ‘She looks like me and my sister. This is so cool!’” Valencia said. “Then, it wasn’t until I was older and realized the source material is horrible. They romanticized this story. That was when I was like, I need to be behind the camera, making these changes, writing stories. Natives are so much more than just leathers and feathers and [being] only in history books.”After completing her undergraduate work at the University of San Diego, Valencia pursued a graduate degree in television and film at Syracuse University, where she was often the only Native student in the room. Her ideas for stories centering Native characters were often denied, but she persisted and eventually landed her first job at Nickelodeon.Now, the 31-year-old showrunner is changing the face of representation in animation, giving Indigenous youth what she wishes she had growing up. After 18 months in the making, “Spirit Rangers” is now streaming on Netflix. The animated children’s show is voiced by Native stars including “Reservation Dogs” actor Devery Jacobs, Wes Studi, Brooke Simpson and voice legend Cree Summer. The series follows three Indigenous siblings named Kodi, Summer and Eddy Skycedar who are tasked with becoming Spirit Rangers and embodying various animals to protect the national park they call home. “When I was working with Chris Nee, who was the creator of ‘Doc McStuffins,’ I saw the way that she told her preschool stories. I was like, this is how ‘Spirit Rangers’ can exist in preschool space. That’s their first intro to media,” Valencia said. “Those are their first friends and their first heroes. How cool is it going to be that Native kids and non-Native kids will just see us in the present day, and also as your favorite action hero who is rescuing buffaloes and condors.”The series is inspired by Valencia’s upbringing and the tribal stories her father would tell her about nature and animals. From nods to frybread and reclaiming transformation to instilling everyday lessons, “Spirit Rangers” is about Native culture, she said, but also serves as a love letter to national parks.“In Indigenous culture, we really feel this reciprocity with nature in general,” Valencia said. “We’re all connected. In some cultures like mine, a really high honor is if you can transform. At the end of the day, while not everyone can transform, you can take care of your land. I feel like you are a park protector, a land protector or a spirit ranger by taking care of your land. It just goes hand in hand with appreciating our Earth and environment.”Valencia said it was important to her that “Spirit Rangers” showcased and included the various perspectives and backgrounds of tribal members. As a “Rugrats” fan in her childhood, she was honored and excited to enlist “A Different World” star Cree Summer for the series. “It is my deepest honor to be a part of ‘Spirit Rangers,’” Summer said. “My mother is Black from Louisiana, and my father is a white man from British Columbia, Ontario. When I was a baby, we moved to Saskatchewan, Canada, to Red Pheasant Reserves, home of the Plains Cree Indians, where we lived and were adopted into the tribe until I was 7 years old.”  Summer has voiced well over 100 animated characters in several TV series, from “Codename: Kids Next Door” to “Pinky, Elmyra, and The Brain.” She is the voice of Lizard on “Spirit Rangers,” a character Summer said represents rebirth and endurance. “Growing up on a reservation, we lived in a mud house, so we didn’t have any running water or electricity. But every now and then somebody would have a TV, and I never saw anything like ‘Spirit Rangers’ — live action, animated or otherwise — no representation of the Indigenous whatsoever,” Summer said.“And as a child, it would have rocked my soul because I believe that cartoons are one of the very first moments in our lives, that we get to see the possibilities of who and what we can be,” she continued. “Because when we’re kids, that’s right when we start to have our best and biggest dreams. Without representation, it makes that very difficult. When I would see a reflection of myself on television or in the movies, and it’s a feeling that you can’t really describe. It just feels like, ‘There’s me!’”Summer hopes “Spirit Rangers” compels people to start a dialogue and enlightens them on the legacies and histories of the First Nations. Most importantly, she wants Native youth to finally be able to see themselves on screen and have their hearts “swell with pride.”For Simpson, “Spirit Rangers” marks her voice acting debut. Hailing from Hollister, North Carolina, and based in Los Angeles, Simpson ascended to fame competing on Season 13 of “The Voice.” A member of the Haliwa-Saponi tribe, Simpson portrays Spider, “a sassy voice of wisdom who’s always ready for an adventure,” she told HuffPost via email.“I have always wanted to step into acting, but solely have been pursuing my music career until I made the leap to Broadway for the revival of ‘1776.’ Broadway, of course, was put on pause over the past couple of years due to the pandemic, so while waiting for Broadway to reopen, ‘Spirit Rangers’ came across my path,” Simpson said. “When I read the script and learned more about the show, I instantly fell in love.” She wrote that her heart melted, thinking of how much she wished this series existed when she was a little girl. For Simpson, her tribe, community and loved ones back home have shown her endless support. This inception of the series and her experience on “Spirit Rangers” has reaffirmed that “there is always room at the table for our voices to be heard,” she said. “To see the next generation of Indigenous leaders actually have creative breakthroughs like ‘Spirit Rangers’ makes me so happy and excited for our future. It’s a reminder that we truly are our ancestors’ wildest dreams,” she wrote. “The same resilience and strength that our ancestors carried is still alive in us today. Indigenous voices have always been here and thanks to you, they are still being heard.”Valencia said “Spirit Rangers” has “healed her inner child” and has been a learning experience, as she discovered the histories about Indigenous communities in the Northeast and the South. Valencia said that through creating “Spirit Rangers,” she had the opportunity to explore what it meant to be a Native child back in the ’90s and change it today for other Native youth.“I’m hoping they feel this sense of acknowledgement like, ‘Hey, we know you’re here. You exist!’ And also give them a sense of pride that they can go around, tell everybody they’re Native, and it won’t come with such a stigma or a stereotype,” Valencia said. “It’s been such an eye-opening series, and there’s so many different tribes that deserve to have their stories told. We only tell a small fraction, so I’m just really excited for Native kids to see themselves and excited for kids to look at nature a little differently.”“Spirit Rangers” is streaming on Netflix.",

And the only thing that could possibly add to my delicious and delightful daily ritual is doing it with an aesthetically-pleasing machine that brews cafe-worthy goodness.If this sounds like something you’re also into, you and I both are in luck: The Technivorm Moccamaster KBGT coffee maker, which you may have seen all over social media, is 41% off right now. According to one reviewer, it’s one fantastic brewer: “The coffee that this machine produces is perfectly on the line of strong and smooth. There is no bitter aftertaste or watery coffee; it is just perfectly brewed coffee at the correct temperature.”This 10-cup coffee maker is handmade in the Netherlands and makes brewing a breeze. It quietly produces up to 40 ounces of coffee in four to six minutes with the push of one switch, ensuring you don’t disturb anyone (or yourself ― sometimes you just need silence in the mornings). It also features a hot plate to keep your coffee warm and an automatic off switch after 100 minutes.Unlike the Moccamaster KBGV, which is also on sale for Cyber Monday, this model has a stainless steel coffee pot rather than glass, making it more durable than its predecessor. But arguably, the best part is its design. It looks incredible in your kitchen. The Moccamaster typically retails for more than $300, but right now it’s a steal. Get it now before you miss your chance.Read on for more promising reviews of the Moccamaster KBGT:“[…] The coffee that this machine produces is perfectly on the line of strong and smooth. There is no bitter aftertaste or watery coffee just perfectly brewed coffee and exactly the correct temperature. Many years ago a friend of mine who owns a couple of McDonald’s told me that the secret is in the temperature and the grind. He was correct, this machine uses copper coils to properly heat water to exactly the right temperature which then cools as it passes through the grinds. What you get is perhaps the best tasting coffee money can buy. As I leave all of my Amazon reviews, I will simply state that if you don’t believe me or if all of the reviews have convinced you, give it a shot… If you don’t like it this is a prime item and Amazon will take it back no questions asked. You literally have nothing to lose. […]” ― Dan Miller “[…] As an engineer, I appreciate designs that anticipate the need for preventive maintenance as well as repair. The Moccamaster is easily disassembled for cleaning, and easy disassembly also means easy repair. Removable parts fit together with simple, clean interlocks, gravity, and (in one case) friction, and the friction fit drip nozzle arm is metal-to-silicone, not cheap plastic. After months of heavy use, I can see no signs of wear, nor is it becoming loose or sloppy. The coffee tastes great. I would not consider myself a coffee scholar, but I know what I like, and I care enough to purchase whole-bean coffee from a local roaster and to grind each day’s coffee fresh in the morning, not in batches. Insulated thermal carafe, rather than an actively warmed pot, is the ONLY way to go if you care about coffee flavor, unless you are sharing with others and will drink a whole pot in a short time. Coffee that is continuously heated after brewing will rapidly acquire a stale, burned taste. It’s vile! […]” ―Scott “Yes, it makes a masterful cup of coffee. Comments from others included the difficulty in pouring from the carafe. The company listened, and the carafe I received has a shaped lip that is easy to pour from. The lack of the built-in timer would have been a dealbreaker for me, except… Other reviewers told how they adapted it to use a Wi-Fi controlled plug. So that is the route that I followed using this Kasa Smart Plug Ultra Mini 15A, Smart Home Wi-Fi Outlet Works with Alexa, Google Home & IFTTT, No Hub Required, UL Certified. I have it set up so that when I put my feet on the floor in the morning, I ask She Who to turn the coffee on. By the time I get my bathrobe and reach the kitchen, the coffee is almost finished brewing. With the convenient, drip stop, I can pour a cup immediately. I have two silly complaints: first, the coffee is too hot for me to drink so I have to put an ice cube in it. This means that it’s perfect in the thermos by lunchtime. My other problem is getting the lid of the thermos open, because the vacuum seal is so superb. So, if you like real coffee, can manage the installation of a smart plug and can break the seal on a tight thermos, this is the coffee maker for you. One final note: I am now having to buy better coffee beans, because I can tell the difference!” ―Raven “When my Behmor coffee maker gave up the ghost this year we decided to look at a different brand. We found this one and it had the features we liked. When we unpacked, cleaned it and used it we were convinced it made a darn good cup of coffee. Filling the reservoir and filling grounds is very easy. The parts are very easy to clean and it produces a little more coffee, at 12 cups, than Behmor which only gave us 10 cups. We work from home so coffee much of the work day is important. We read the comments before we purchased and one person said something about making sure the filter is all the down in the grounds holder otherwise the coffee may overflow before it gets to the carafe. We only had this happen once but we keep the coffee maker in a tray anyway because had issues with overflowing with our last coffee maker. The carafe is glass lined and so we don’t have to worry about burning the carafe and the carafe is so efficient the coffee stays hot for hours. It’s actually warm in the morning.” ―Love to read “We bought this machine because our kids bought one while living in the Netherlands. It brewed such good tasting, clean cup of coffee. It brews a 10 cup pot within 5 minutes. It has a great bloom and no spilage! It also looks good on our counter! It’s a bit pricey but of you are fussy about your coffee, don’t go to Starbucks, but this machine! I guarantee you’ll love this brewer!” ―plumbermann",
